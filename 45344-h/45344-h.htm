<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>It was in 1856 that I first had my attention called to
the subject of flying machines. My father, who was a
profound thinker and a clever mechanician, seems to have
given the subject a great deal of thought, and to have
matured a plan identical with what has been proposed by
hundreds since that time. I was then sixteen years of
age, and a fairly good mechanician, and any new thing in
the mechanical line interested me immensely.</p>

<p>My father&#8217;s proposed machine, of which he made a
sketch, was of the H&eacute;licopt&egrave;re type, having two screws
both on the same axis&mdash;the lower one to be right hand
and mounted on a tubular shaft, and the top one to be left
hand and mounted on a solid shaft running through the
lower tubular shaft. These screws were to be rotated in
reverse directions by means of a small pinion engaging a
bevel gear attached to each of the shafts. His plan contemplated
large screws with very fine pitch, and he
proposed to obtain horizontal motion by inclining the axis
forward. He admitted that there was no motor in
existence light enough, but thought one might be invented,
and that an engine might be worked by a series of explosions
in the cylinder, that is, what is known to-day as
internal combustion; but he was not clear how such an
engine could be produced. He, however, said that a flying
machine would be so valuable in time of war, that it
mattered little how expensive the explosive might be,
even if fulminate of mercury had to be used. It is
interesting to note in this connection that the great Peter
Cooper of New York thought out an identical machine
about the same time, and actually commenced experiments.
It seems that this gentleman regarded fulminate of mercury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
as altogether too feeble and inert, because we find that
he selected chloride of nitrogen as his explosive agent.
However, his work was soon brought to an end by the
loss of the sight of one eye, after which time he had no
further dealings with this lively explosive.</p>

<p>The many early conversations that I had with my father
on the subject kept the matter constantly before me, and
I think it was in 1872, after having seen Roper&#8217;s hot-air
engine and Brayton&#8217;s petroleum engine, that I took the
matter up, and commenced to make drawings of a machine
of the H&eacute;licopt&egrave;re type, but instead of having one screw
above the other, I saw at once that it would be much
better if the two screws were widely separated, so that
each would engage new air, the inertia of which had not
been disturbed. The designing of the machine itself was
a simple matter, but the engine gave me trouble. No
matter from what point I examined the subject, the engine
was always too heavy. It appears that the Brayton engine
was shown at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia
in 1876, and that Otto visited this exhibition. Up to that
time, he had been making a species of rocket engine&mdash;that is,
an engine in which an explosive mixture shot the piston
upward and then sucked it back, a rack and pinion
transmitting movement to the rotating shaft by means of a
pawl and ratchet. He appears to have been much interested
in the Brayton engine, as it was evidently very much
in advance of his own. It actually developed, even at that
time, one horse-power per hour for every pound of crude
petroleum consumed, but it was very heavy indeed, very
difficult to start, and not always reliable. The shaft that
worked the valve gear was parallel to the cylinder, and
placed in the exact position occupied by a similar shaft in
the present Otto engine, but instead of revolving only
half as fast as the crank shaft, it made the same number of
revolutions. On Otto&#8217;s return to Germany, he evidently
profited by what he had seen, and made a new engine,
which in reality was a cross between his own and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
Brayton; the result was a very important invention, which
has been of incalculable value to mankind. It is this
engine which is now propelling our motor cars, and it
is the only engine suitable for employment on a flying
machine; but even this motor was not in a sufficiently
high state of development as far as lightness was concerned,
to be of any use to me. The drawings which I made in
1873, although of little or no value, kept my thoughts on
artificial flight, and while I was away from home attending
to business, especially when in foreign countries, I often
amused myself by making mathematical calculations.
Quite true, the formula which I used at the time&mdash;Haswell&#8217;s&mdash;was
not correct; still, it was near enough
to the mark to be of considerable value. Moreover, the
error in this formula affected the H&eacute;licopt&egrave;re quite as
much as the aeroplane system, and as I was working with
the view of ascertaining the relative merits of the two
systems, the error, although considerable, did not have any
influence at all in the decision which I arrived at&mdash;namely,
that the aeroplane system was the best. The machine
that I thought out at that time contemplated superposed
aeroplanes of very great length from port to starboard.
The size in the other direction was more for the purpose
of preventing a rapid fall than for a lifting effect. I saw
that it would be necessary to have horizontal fore and aft
rudders placed a long distance apart, so as to prevent rapid
pitching, and it appeared to me that the further these
rudders were apart, the easier it would be to man&#339;uvre
the machine. As I never had any doubts regarding the
efficiency of screw propellers working in the air, I decided
to use two of these of a large size rotating in opposite
directions. Of course, all this speculation was theory only,
but I verified it later on by actual experiments before
I built my machine, and it is very gratifying to me to
know that all the successful flying machines of to-day are
built on the lines which I had thought out at that time,
and found to be the best. All have superposed aeroplanes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
of great length from port to starboard, all have fore and
aft horizontal rudders, and all are driven with screw
propellers. The change from my model is only a change
in the framework made possible by dispensing with the
boiler, water tank, and steam engine. In this little work,
I have dealt at considerable length with air currents, the
flight of birds, and the behaviour of kites, perhaps at the
expense of some repetitions; as the resemblance between
kite flying and the soaring of birds is similar in many
respects, repetitions are necessary. To those who go to
sea in ships, it is necessary to know something of the
currents they are liable to encounter; if it be a sailing ship,
certainly a knowledge of the air currents is of the greatest
importance, and so it is with flying machines. If flights
of any considerable distance are to be made, the machine is
liable at any time to encounter very erratic air currents,
and it has been my aim in discussing these three subjects&mdash;air
currents, birds, and kites&mdash;to bring them before the
would-be navigators of the air, in order that they may
anticipate the difficulties they have to deal with and
be ready to combat them. Then, again, there has been
almost an infinite amount of discussion regarding the
soaring of birds and the flying of kites. Many years
ago, after reading numerous works on the subject of
flight, I became a close observer myself, and always
sought in my travels to learn as much as possible. I
have attempted to discuss this subject in simple and
easily understood language, and to present sufficient
evidence to prevent the necessity of any further disputes.
I do not regard what I have said as a theory, but simply
as a plain statement of absolute and easily demonstrated
facts. During the last few years, a considerable number
of text-books and scientific treatises have been written
on the subject of artificial flight, the most elaborate and
by far the most reliable of these being the &#8220;Pocket-Book
of Aeronautics,&#8221; by Herman W. L. Moedebeck, Major
und Battaillonskommandeur im Badischen Fussartillerie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
Regiment No. 14; in collaboration with O. Chanute
and others. Translated by W. Mansergh Varley, B.A.,
D.Sc., Ph.D., and published by Whittaker &amp; Co. This
work does not, however, confine itself altogether to flying
machines, but has a great deal of information which is of
little or no value to the builder of true flying machines;
moreover, it is not simple enough to be readily understood
by the majority of experimenters. In some other works
which I have recently examined, I find a confusing mass of
the most intricate mathematical calculations, abounding in
an almost infinite number of characters, and extending over
hundreds of pages, but on a close examination of some of
the deductions arrived at, I find that a good many of the
mathematical equations are based on a mistaken hypothesis,
and the results arrived at are very wide of the truth. I
have shown several diagrams which will explain what
I mean. What is required by experimenters in flying
machines&mdash;and there will soon be a great number of them&mdash;is
a treatise which they can understand, and which requires
no more delicate instruments than a carpenter&#8217;s 2-foot rule
and a grocer&#8217;s scales. The calculations relating to the lift,
drift, and the skin friction of an aeroplane are extremely
simple, and it is quite possible to so place this matter that
it can be understood by anyone who has the least smattering
of mathematical knowledge. Mathematics of the
higher order expressed in elaborate formul&aelig; do very well
in communications between college professors&mdash;that is, if
they happen to be agreed. When, however, these calculations
are so intricate as to require a clever mathematician
a whole day to study out the meaning of a single page,
and if when the riddle is solved, we find that these
calculations are based on a fallacy, and the results in
conflict with facts, it becomes quite evident to the actual
experimenter that they are of little value. For many
years, Newton&#8217;s law was implicitly relied upon. Chanute,
after going over my experimental work, wrote that Newton&#8217;s
law was out as 20 is to 1&mdash;that is, that an aeroplane would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
lift twenty times as much in practice as could be shown by
the use of Newton&#8217;s formula. Some recent experiments,
which I have made myself, at extremely high velocities
and at a very low angle, seem to demonstrate that the
error is nearer 100 to 1 than 20 to 1. It will, therefore,
be seen how little this subject was understood until quite
recently, and even now the mathematicians who write
books and use such an immense amount of formul&aelig;, do not
agree by any means, as will be witnessed by the mass of
conflicting controversy which has been appearing in
<i>Engineering</i> during the last four months. When an
aeroplane placed at a working angle of, say, 1 in 10 is
driven through the air at a high velocity, it, of course,
pushes the air beneath it downwards at one-tenth part of
its forward velocity&mdash;that is, in moving 10 feet, it pushes
the air down 1 foot. A good many mathematicians rely
altogether upon the acceleration of the mass of air beneath
the aeroplane which is accelerated by its march through
the air, the value of this acceleration being in proportion to
the square of the velocity which is imparted to it. Suppose
now that the aeroplane is thin and well-made, that both
top and bottom sides are equally smooth and perfect; not
only does the air engaged by the under side shoot downwards,
but the air also follows the exact contour of
the top side, and is also shot downwards with the same
mean velocity as that passing on the underneath side, so if
we are going to consider the lifting effect of the aeroplane,
we must not leave out of the equation, the air above the
aeroplane, which has quite as much mass and the same
acceleration imparted to it, as the air below the aeroplane.
Even calculations made on this basis will not bring the
lifting effect of an aeroplane up to what it actually does lift
in practice; in fact, the few mathematicians who have made
experiments themselves have referred to the actual lifting
effect of aeroplanes placed at a low angle and travelling at
a high velocity as being unaccountable. Only a few
mathematicians appear to have a proper grasp of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
subject. However, three could be pointed out who understand
the subject thoroughly, but these are all mathematicians
of the very highest order&mdash;Lord Kelvin, Lord
Rayleigh, and Professor Langley. In placing before the
public, the results of my experiments and the conclusions
arrived at, it is necessary to show the apparatus which I
employed, otherwise it might be inferred that my conclusions
were guesswork, or mathematical calculations which
might or might not be founded on a mistaken hypothesis;
this is my excuse for showing my boiler and engine, my
rotating arm, and my large machine. I do not anticipate
that anyone will ever use a steam engine again, because
any form of a boiler is heavy; moreover, the amount of
fuel required is much greater than with an internal combustion
engine, and certainly seven times as much water
has to be dealt with. However, the description which
I am giving of my apparatus will demonstrate that I had
the instruments for doing the experimental work that I
have described in this work. In the <a href="#Page_130">Appendix</a> will be
found a description of my machine, and some of my
apparatus. The conclusions which I arrived at were written
down at the time with a considerable degree of care, and
are of interest because they show that, at that date, I had
produced a machine that lifted considerably more than its
own weight and had all of the essential elements, as far as
superposed aeroplanes, fore and aft horizontal rudders, and
screw propellers were concerned, common to all of the
successful machines which have since been made. The
fact that practically no essential departure has been made
from my original lines, indicates to my mind that I had
reasoned out the best type of a machine even before I
commenced a stroke of the work.</p>

<p>I have to thank Mr. Albert T. Thurston for reading the
proofs of this work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="chapname">INTRODUCTORY.</span></h2>

<p>It has been my aim in preparing this little work for
publication to give a description of my own experimental
work, and explain the machinery and methods that have
enabled me to arrive at certain conclusions regarding
the problem of flight. The results of my experiments
did not agree with the accepted mathematical formul&aelig; of
that time. I do not wish this little work to be considered as
a mathematical text-book; I leave that part of the problem
to others, confining myself altogether to data obtained by
my own actual experiments and observations. During
the last few years, a considerable number of text-books
have been published. These have for the most part been
prepared by professional mathematicians, who have led
themselves to believe that all problems connected with
mundane life are susceptible of solution by the use of
mathematical formul&aelig;, providing, of course, that the
number of characters employed are numerous enough.
When the Arabic alphabet used in the English language
is not sufficient, they exhaust the Greek also, and it even
appears that both of these have to be supplemented sometimes
by the use of Chinese characters. As this latter
supply is unlimited, it is evidently a move in the right
direction. Quite true, many of the factors in the problems
with which they have to deal are completely unknown
and unknowable; still they do not hesitate to work out
a complete solution without the aid of any experimental
data at all. If the result of their calculations should not
agree with facts, &#8220;bad luck to the facts.&#8221; Up to twenty
years ago, Newton&#8217;s erroneous law as relates to atmospheric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
resistance was implicitly relied upon, and it was
not the mathematician who detected its error, in fact, we
have plenty of mathematicians to-day who can prove by
formul&aelig; that Newton&#8217;s law is absolutely correct and
unassailable. It was an experimenter that detected the
fault in Newton&#8217;s law. In one of the little mathematical
treatises that I have before me, I find drawings of aeroplanes
set at a high and impracticable angle with dotted
lines showing the manner in which the writer thinks the
air is deflected on coming in contact with them. The
dotted lines show that the air which strikes the lower
or front side of the aeroplane, instead of following the
surface and being discharged at the lower or trailing edge,
takes a totally different and opposite path, moving forward
and over the top or forward edge, producing a large eddy
of confused currents at the rear and top side of the aeroplane.
It is very evident that the air never takes the
erratic path shown in these drawings; moreover, the angle
of the aeroplane is much greater than one would ever
think of employing on an actual flying machine. Fully
two pages of closely written mathematical formul&aelig; follow,
all based on this mistaken hypothesis. It is only too
evident that mathematics of this kind can be of little use
to the serious experimenter. The mathematical equation
relating to the lift and drift of a well-made aeroplane is
extremely simple; at any practicable angle from 1 in 20
to 1 in 5, the lifting effect will be just as much greater
than the drift, as the width of the plane is greater than
the elevation of the front edge above the horizontal&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
is, if we set an aeroplane at an angle of 1 in 10, and
employ 1 lb. pressure for pushing this aeroplane forward,
the aeroplane will lift 10 lbs. If we change the angle
to 1 in 16, the lift will be 16 times as great as the drift.
It is quite true that as the front edge of the aeroplane
is raised, its projected horizontal area is reduced&mdash;that
is, if we consider the width of the aeroplane as a radius,
the elevation of the front edge will reduce its projected
horizontal area just in the proportion that the versed sine
is increased. For instance, suppose the sine of the angle
to be one-sixth of the radius, giving, of course, to the
aeroplane an inclination of 1 in 6, which is the sharpest
practical angle, this only reduces the projected area about
2 per cent., while the lower and more practical angles
are reduced considerably less than 1 per cent. It will,
therefore, be seen that this factor is so small that it may
not be considered at all in practical flight.</p>

<p>Some of the mathematicians have demonstrated by
formul&aelig;, unsupported by facts, that there is a considerable
amount of skin friction to be considered, but as no
two agree on this or any other subject, some not agreeing
to-day with what they wrote a year ago, I think we
might put down all of their results, add them together,
and then divide by the number of mathematicians, and
thus find the average coefficient of error. When we
subject this question to experimental test, we find that
nearly all of the mathematicians are radically wrong,
Professor Langley, of course, excepted. I made an aeroplane
of hard rolled brass, 20 gauge; it was 1 foot wide
and dead smooth on both sides; I gave it a curvature
of about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch and filed the edges, thin and sharp. I
mounted this with a great deal of care in a perfectly
horizontal blast of air of 40 miles an hour. When this
aeroplane was placed at any angle between 1 in 8 and
1 in 20, the lifting effect was always just in proportion to
its angle. The distance that the front edge was raised
above the horizontal, as compared with the width of
the aeroplane, was always identical with the drift as
compared with the lift. On account of the jarring effect
caused by the rotation of the screws that produced the
air blast, we might consider that all of the articulated
joints about the weighing device were absolutely frictionless,
as the jar would cause them to settle into the proper
position quite irrespective of friction. I was, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
able to observe very carefully, the lift and the drift. As
an example of how these experiments were conducted, I
would say that the engine employed was provided with a
very sensitive and accurate governor; the power transmission
was also quite reliable. Before making these
tests, the apparatus was tested as regards the drift, without
any aeroplane in position, and with weights applied
that would just balance any effect that the wind might
have on everything except the aeroplane. The aeroplane
was then put in position and the other system of weights
applied until it exactly balanced, all the levers being
rapped in order to eliminate the friction in their joints.
The engine was then started and weights applied just
sufficient to counterbalance the lifting effect of the aeroplane,
and other weights applied to exactly balance the
drift or the tendency to travel with the wind. In this
way, I was able to ascertain, with a great degree of
accuracy, the relative difference between the lift and drift.
If there had been any skin friction, even to the extent of
2 per cent., it would have been detected. This brass
aeroplane was tested at various angles, and always gave
the same results, but of course I could not use thick brass
aeroplanes on a flying machine; it was necessary for me
to seek something much lighter. I therefore conducted
experiments with other materials, the results of which
are given. However, with a well-made wooden aeroplane
1 foot wide and with a thickness in the centre of <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch,
I obtained results almost identical with those of the very
much thinner brass aeroplane, but it must not be supposed
that in practice an aeroplane is completely without friction.
If it is very rough, irregular in shape, and has any projections
whatsoever on either the top or bottom side,
there will be a good deal of friction, although it may not,
strictly speaking, be skin friction; still, it will absorb the
power, and the coefficient of this friction may be anything
from &middot;05 to &middot;40. These experiments with the brass aeroplane
demonstrated that the lifting effect was in direct
proportion to the angle, and that skin friction, if it exists
at all, was extremely small, but this does not agree with
a certain kind of reasoning which can be made very
plausible and is consequently generally accepted.</p>

<p>Writers of books, as a rule, have always supposed that
the lifting effect of an aeroplane was not in proportion
to its inclination, but in proportion to the square of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
sine of the angle. In order to make this matter clear, I
will explain. Suppose that an aeroplane is 20 inches wide
and the front edge is raised 1 inch above the horizontal.
In ordinary parlance this is, of course, called an inclination
of 1 in 20, but mathematicians approach it from a different
standpoint. They regard the width of the aeroplane as
unity or the radius, and the 1 inch that the front edge
is raised as a fraction of unity. The geometrical name
of this 1 inch is the sine of the angle&mdash;that is, it is the
sine of the angle at which the aeroplane is raised above
the horizontal. Suppose, now, that we have another
identical aeroplane and we raise the front edge 2 inches
above the horizontal. It is very evident that, under
these conditions, the sine of the angle will be twice as
much, and that the square of the sine of the angle will
be four times as great. All the early mathematicians,
and some of those of the present day, imagine that the
lift must be in proportion to the square of the sine of
the angle. They reason it out as follows:&mdash;If an aeroplane
is forced through the air at a given velocity, the
aeroplane in which the sine of the angle is 2 inches will
push the air down with twice as great a velocity as the
one in which the sine of the angle is only 1 inch, and
as the force of the wind blowing against a normal plane
increases as the square of the velocity, the same law holds
good in driving a normal plane through still air. From
this reasoning, one is led to suppose that an aeroplane set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
at an angle of 1 in 10 will lift four times as much as one
in which the inclination is only 1 in 20, but experiments
have shown that this theory is very wide of the truth.
There are dozens of ways of showing, by pure mathematics,
that Newton&#8217;s law is quite correct; but in building
a flying machine no theory is good that does not correspond
with facts, and it is a fact, without any question, that the
lifting effect of an aeroplane, instead of increasing as the
square of the sine of the angle, only increases as the angle.
Lord Kelvin, when he visited my place, was, I think, the
first to mention this, and point out that Newton&#8217;s law was
at fault. Professor Langley also pointed out the fallacy
of Newton&#8217;s law, and other experimenters have found that
the lifting effect does not increase as the square of the
sine of the angle. In order to put this matter at rest,
Lord Rayleigh, who, I think we must all admit, would
not be likely to make a mistake, made some very simple
experiments, in which he demonstrated that two aeroplanes,
in which we may consider the sine of the angle
to be <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch, lifted slightly more than a similar aeroplane
in which the sine of the angle was only <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch. Of course,
Lord Rayleigh did not express it in inches, but in term of
the radius. His aeroplanes were, however, very small. We
can rely upon it that the lifting effect of an aeroplane at
any practical angle, everything else being equal, increases in
direct proportion to the angle of the inclination. In this
little work, I have attempted to make things as simple
as possible; it has not been written for mathematicians,
and I have, therefore, thought best to express myself in
inches instead of in degrees. If I write, &#8220;an inclination
of 1 in 20,&#8221; everyone will understand it, and only a
carpenter&#8217;s 2-foot rule is required to ascertain what the
angle is. Then, again, simple measurements make calculations
much simpler, and the lifting effect is at once
understood without any computations being necessary.
If the angles are expressed in degrees and minutes, it
is necessary to have a protractor or a text-book in order
to find out what the inclination really is. When I made
my experiments, I only had in mind the obtaining of
correct data, to enable me to build a flying machine that
would lift itself from the ground. At that time I was
extremely busy, and during the first two years of my
experimental work, I was out of England fourteen months.
After having made my apparatus, I conducted my experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
rather quickly, it is true, but I intended later on
to go over them systematically and deliberately, make
many more experiments, write down results, and prepare
some account of them for publication. However, the
property where I made these experiments was sold by
the company owning it, and my work was never finished,
so I am depending on the scraps of data that were written
down at the time. I am also publishing certain observations
that I wrote down shortly after I had succeeded in
lifting more than the weight of my machine. I think
that the experiments which I made with an aeroplane
only 8 inches wide will be found the most reliable. All
the machinery was running smoothly, and the experiments
were conducted with a considerable degree of care. In
making any formula on the lifting effect of the aeroplane,
it should be based on what was accomplished with the
8-inch plane. Only a few experiments were made to
ascertain the relative value of planes of different widths.
However, I think we must all admit that a wide plane
is not as economical in power as a narrow one. In order
to make this matter plain, suppose that we have one
aeroplane placed at such an angle that it will lift 2 lbs.
per square foot at a velocity of 40 miles an hour; it is
very evident that the air just at the rear of this aeroplane
would be moving downward at a velocity corresponding
to the acceleration imparted to it by the plane. If we
wish to obtain lifting effect on this air by another plane
of exactly the same width, we shall have to increase its
inclination in order to obtain the same lifting effect, and,
still further, it will be necessary to use more power in
proportion to the load lifted. If a third aeroplane is used,
it must be placed at an angle that will impart additional
acceleration to the air, and so on. Each plane that we
add will have to be placed at a sharper angle, and the
power required will be just in proportion to the average
angle of all the planes. As the action of a wide aeroplane
is identical with that of numerous narrow ones placed in
close proximity to each other, it is very evident that a
wide aeroplane cannot be as efficient in proportion to its
width as a narrow one. I have thought the matter over,
and I should say that the lifting effect of a flat aeroplane
increases rather faster than the square root of
its width. This will, at least, do for a working hypothesis.
Every flying machine must have what we will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
call &#8220;a length of entering edge&#8221;&mdash;that is, the sum of
entering edges of all the aeroplanes must bear a fixed
relation to the load carried. If a machine is to have its
lifting effect doubled, it is necessary to have the length
of entering edge twice as long. This additional length
may, of course, be obtained by superposed planes, but as
we may assume that a large aeroplane will travel faster
than a small one, increased velocity will compensate in
some degree for the greater width of larger aeroplanes.
By careful study of the experiments which I have made,
I think it is quite safe to state that the lifting effect of
well-made aeroplanes, if we do not take into consideration
the resistance due to the framework holding them in
position, increases as the square of their velocity. Double
their speed and they give four times the lifting effect.
The higher the speed, the smaller the angle of the plane,
and the greater the lifting effect in proportion to the
power employed. When we build a steamship, we know
that its weight increases as the cube of any one of its
dimensions&mdash;that is, if the ship is twice as long, twice
as wide, and twice as deep it will carry eight times as
much; but at the very best, with even higher speed,
the load carried by a flying machine will only increase
with the square of any one of its dimensions, or perhaps
still less. No matter whether it is a ship, a locomotive,
or a flying machine that we wish to build, we must first
of all consider the ideal, and then approximate it as closely
as possible with the material at hand. Suppose it were
possible to make a perfect screw, working without friction,
and that its weight should only be that of the surrounding
air; if it should be 200 feet in diameter, the power of one
man, properly applied, would lift him into the air. This
is because the area of a circle 200 feet in diameter is so
great that the weight of a man would not cause it to fall
through the air at a velocity greater than the man would
be able to climb up a ladder. If the diameter should be
increased to 400 feet, then a man would be able to carry
a passenger as heavy as himself on his flying machine, and
if we should increase it still further, to 2,000 feet, the
weight of a horse could be sustained in still air by the
power which one man could put forth. On the other
hand, if we should reduce the diameter of the screw to
20 feet, then it would certainly require the power of one
horse to lift the weight of one man, and, if we made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
screw small enough, it might even require the power of
100 horses to lift the same weight. It will, therefore,
be seen that everything depends upon the area of the
air engaged, and in designing a machine we should seek
to engage as much air as possible, so long as we can
keep down the weight. Suppose that a flying machine
should be equipped with a screw 10 feet in diameter,
with a pitch of 6 feet, and that the motor developed
40 horse-power and gave the screw 1,000 turns a minute,
producing a screw thrust, we will say, of about 220 lbs.
If we should increase the diameter of the screw to 20 feet,
and if it had the same pitch and revolved at the same
rate, it would require four times as much power and
would give four times as much screw thrust, because the
area of the disc increases as the square of the diameter.
Suppose, now, that we should reduce the pitch of the
screw to 3 feet, we should in this case engage four times
as much air, and double the screw thrust without using
any more power&mdash;that is, assuming that the machine is
stationary and that the full power of the engine is being
used for accelerating the air. The advantages of a large
screw will, therefore, be obvious. I have been unable to
obtain correct data regarding the experiments which have
taken place with the various machines on the Continent.
I have, however, seen these machines, and I should say
when they are in flight, providing that the engine develops
40 horse-power, that fully 28 horse-power is lost in screw
slip, and the remainder in forcing the machine through
the air. These machines weigh 1,000 lbs. each, and their
engines are said to be 50 horse-power. The lifting effect,
therefore, per horse-power is 20 lbs. If the aeroplanes
were perfect in shape and set at a proper angle, and the
resistance of the framework reduced to a minimum, the
same lifting effect ought to be produced with an expenditure
of less than half this amount of power, providing,
of course, that the screw be of proper dimensions. It is
said that Professor Langley and Mr. Horatio Philipps, by
eliminating the factor of friction altogether, or by not
considering it in their calculations, have succeeded in
lifting at the rate of 200 lbs. per horse-power. The
apparatus they employed was very small. The best I
ever did with my very much larger apparatus&mdash;and
I only did it on one occasion&mdash;was to carry 133 lbs. per
horse-power. In my large machine experiments, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
amazed at the tremendous amount of power necessary to
drive the framework and the numerous wires through the
air. It appeared to me, from these experiments, that
the air resisted very strongly being cut up by wires. I
expected to raise my machine in the air by using only
100 horse-power, and my first condenser was made so
that it did actually condense water enough to supply
100 horse-power, but the framework offered such a tremendous
resistance that I was compelled to strengthen
all of the parts, make the machine heavier, and increase
the boiler pressure and piston speed until I actually ran
it up to 362 horse-power. This, however, was not the
indicated horse-power. It was arrived at by multiplying
the pitch of the screws, in feet, by the number of turns
that they made in a minute, and by the screw thrust in
pounds, and then dividing the product by the conventional
unit 33,000. I have no doubt that the indicated horse-power
would have been fully 400. On one occasion I
ran my machine over the track with all the aeroplanes
removed. I knew what steam pressure was required to
run my machine with the aeroplanes in position at a speed
of 40 miles an hour. With the planes removed, it still
required a rather high steam pressure to obtain this
velocity, but I made no note at the time of the exact
difference. It was not, however, by any means so great
as one would have supposed. From the foregoing, it will
be seen how necessary it is to consider atmospheric resistance.
Although I do not expect that anyone will ever
again attempt to make a flying machine driven by a steam
engine, still, I have thought best to give a short and concise
description of my engine and boiler, in order that my
readers may understand what sort of an apparatus I
employed to obtain the data I am now, for the first time,
placing before the public. A full description of everything
relating to the motor power was written down at the time,
and has been carefully preserved. An abridgement of this
will be found in the <a href="#Page_130">Appendix</a>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="chapname">AIR CURRENTS AND THE FLIGHT OF BIRDS.</span></h2>

<p>In Mr. Darwin&#8217;s &#8220;Voyage of the Beagle&#8221; I find<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;When the condors are wheeling in a flock round and
round any spot their flight is beautiful. Except when
rising from the ground, I do not remember ever having
seen one of these birds flap its wings. Near Lima I
watched several for nearly half an hour, without taking
off my eyes; they moved in large curves, sweeping in
circles, descending and ascending without giving a single
flap. As they glided close over my head I intently watched
from an oblique position, the outlines of the separate and
great terminal feathers of each wing, and these separate
feathers, if there had been the least vibratory movement,
would have appeared as if blended together; but they
were seen distinct against the blue sky.&#8221;</p>

<p>Man is essentially a land animal, and it is quite possible
if Nature had not placed before him numerous examples
of birds and insects that are able to fly, he would never
have thought of attempting it himself. But birds are very
much in evidence, and mankind from the very earliest
times has not only admired the ease and rapidity with
which they are able to move from place to place, but has
always aspired to imitate them. The number of attempts
that have been made to solve this problem has been very
great; but it was not until quite recently that science and
mechanics had advanced far enough to put in the hands
of experimenters suitable material to attack the problem.
Perhaps nothing better has ever been written regarding
our aspirations to imitate the flight of birds than what
Prof. Langley has said<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Nature has made her flying machine in the bird, which
is nearly a thousand times as heavy as the air its bulk
displaces, and only those who have tried to rival it know
how inimitable her work is, for &#8216;the way of a bird in the
air&#8217; remains as wonderful to us as it was to Solomon,
and the sight of the bird has constantly held this wonder
before men&#8217;s eyes, and in some men&#8217;s minds, and kept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
flame of hope from utter extinction, in spite of long disappointment.
I well remember how, as a child, when lying
in a New England pasture, I watched a hawk soaring far
up in the blue, and sailing for a long time without any
motion of its wings, as though it needed no work to sustain
it, but was kept up there by some miracle. But, however
sustained, I saw it sweep, in a few seconds of its leisurely
flight, over a distance that to me was encumbered with
every sort of obstacle, which did not exist for it. The
wall over which I had climbed when I left the road, the
ravine I had crossed, the patch of undergrowth through
which I had pushed my way&mdash;all these were nothing to
the bird&mdash;and while the road had only taken me in one
direction, the bird&#8217;s level highway led everywhere, and
opened the way into every nook and corner of the landscape.
How wonderfully easy, too, was its flight. There
was not a flutter of its pinions as it swept over the field,
in a motion which seemed as effortless as that of its
shadow.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the last 50 years a great deal has been said and
written in regard to the flight of birds; no other natural
phenomenon has excited so much interest and been so
imperfectly understood. Learned treatises have been
written to prove that a bird is able to develop from ten
to twenty times as much power for its weight as other
animals, while other equally learned works have shown
most conclusively that no greater amount of energy is
exerted by a bird in flying than by land animals in
running or jumping.</p>

<p>Prof. Langley, who was certainly a very clever observer
and a mathematician of the first order, in discussing the
subject relating to the power exerted by birds in flight and
the old formula relating to the subject, expresses himself
as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;After many years and in mature life, I was brought
to think of these things again, and to ask myself whether
the problem of artificial flight was as hopeless and as
absurd as it was then thought to be. Nature had solved
it, and why not man? Perhaps it was because he had
begun at the wrong end, and attempted to construct
machines to fly before knowing the principles on which
flight rested. I turned for these principles to my books
and got no help. Sir Isaac Newton had indicated a rule
for finding the resistance to advance through the air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
which seemed, if correct, to call for enormous mechanical
power, and a distinguished French mathematician had
given a formula showing how rapidly the power must
increase with the velocity of flight, and according to
which a swallow, to attain a speed it is known to reach,
must be possessed of the strength of a man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remembering the effortless flight of the soaring bird,
it seemed that the first thing to do was to discard rules
which led to such results, and to commence new experiments,
not to build a flying machine at once, but to find
the principles upon which one should be built; to find,
for instance, with certainty by direct trial how much
horse-power was needed to sustain a surface of given
weight by means of its motion through the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is no question but what a bird has a higher
physical development, as far as the generation of power
is concerned, than any other animal we know of. Nevertheless,
I think that everyone who has made a study of
the question will agree that some animals, such as hares
and rabbits, exert quite as much power in running, in
proportion to their weight, as a sea-gull or an eagle does
in flying.</p>

<p>The amount of power which a land animal has to exert
is always a fixed and definite quantity. If an animal
weighing 100 lbs. has to ascend a hill 100 feet high, it
always means the development of 10,000 foot-lbs. With
a bird, however, there is no such thing as a fixed quantity.
If a bird weighing 100 lbs. should raise itself into the air
100 feet during a perfect calm, the amount of energy
developed would be 10,000 foot lbs. plus the slip of the
wings. But, as a matter of fact, the air in which a bird
flies is never stationary, as I propose to show; it is always
moving either up or down, and soaring birds, by a very
delicate sense of feeling, always take advantage of a rising
column. If a bird finds itself in a column of air which is
descending, it is necessary for it to work its wings very
rapidly in order to prevent a descent to the earth.</p>

<p>I have often observed the flight of hawks and eagles.
They seem to glide through the air with hardly any movement
of their wings. Sometimes, however, they stop and
hold themselves in a stationary position directly over a
certain spot, carefully watching something on the earth
immediately below. In such cases they often work their
wings with great rapidity, evidently expending an enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
amount of energy. When, however, they cease to hover
and commence to move again through the air, they appear
to keep themselves at the same height with an almost
imperceptible expenditure of power.</p>

<p>Many unscientific observers of the flight of birds have
imagined that a wind or a <i>horizontal</i> movement of the air
is all that is necessary to sustain the weight of a bird in
the air after the manner of a kite. If, however, the wind,
which is only air in motion, should be blowing everywhere
at exactly the same velocity, and in the same direction&mdash;horizontally&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
would offer no more sustaining power to a
bird than a dead calm, because there is nothing to prevent
the body of the bird from being blown along with the air,
and whenever it attained the same velocity as the air, no
possible arrangement of the wings could prevent it from
falling to the earth.</p>

<p>It is well known that only a short distance above the
earth&#8217;s surface, say 30 or 40 miles, we find an extremely
low temperature sometimes referred to as interstellar
temperature or absolute zero. In order to illustrate the
extremely low temperature of space, I would cite the
following instance<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>One evening, in the State of Ohio, a farmer saw a very
brilliant meteor; it struck in one of his fields not more
than 100 feet from his house. He at once rushed to the
spot, and, pushing his arm down the hole, succeeded in
touching it; but he very quickly withdrew his hand, as he
found it extremely hot. Some of the neighbours rushed
to the spot, and he told them what had occurred, whereupon
one of them put his hand in the hole, expecting to be
burnt, but, much to his surprise, the tips of his wet fingers
were instantly frozen to the meteor. The meteor had been
travelling at such an exceedingly high velocity that the
resistance of the intensely cold and highly attenuated outer
atmosphere was sufficient to bring its temperature up to
the melting point of iron; but the heat did not have time
to pass into the interior, it only extended inwards perhaps
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch, so that when the meteor came to a state of rest,
the heat of the exterior was soon absorbed by the intensely
cold interior, thus reducing the surface to a temperature
much below any natural temperature that we find at the
surface of the earth.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more certain than that the temperature
is extremely low a slight distance above the earth&#8217;s surface.
As the air near the earth never falls in temperature to
anything like the absolute zero, it follows that there is a
constant change going on, the relatively warm air near the
surface of the earth always ascending, and, in some cases,
doing sufficient work in expanding to render a portion of
the water it contains visible, forming clouds, rain, or snow,
while the very cold air is constantly descending to take
the place of the rising column of warm air. I have noticed
a considerable degree of regularity in the movement of the
air, especially at a long distance from land, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
regularity of the up and down currents is, at times, very
marked.</p>

<p>On one occasion while crossing the Atlantic in fine
weather I noticed, some miles directly ahead of the ship,
a long line of glassy water. Small waves indicated that
the wind was blowing in the exact direction in which the
ship was moving, and as we approached the glassy line,
the waves became smaller and smaller until they completely
disappeared in a mirror-like surface, which was
about 300 or 400 feet wide, and extended both to the
port and starboard in approximately a straight line as
far as the eye could reach. After passing the centre of
this zone, I noticed that small waves began to show themselves,
but in the exact opposite direction to those through
which we had already passed, and these waves became
larger and larger for nearly half an hour. Then they
began to get gradually smaller, when I observed another
glassy line directly ahead of the ship. As we approached
it, the waves again completely disappeared, but after passing
through it, the wind was blowing in the opposite direction,
and the waves increased in size exactly in the same manner
that they had diminished on the opposite side of the glassy
streak (<a href="#Fig4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>This, of course, shows that directly over the centre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the first glassy streak, the air was meeting from both
sides and ascending in practically a straight line from the
surface of the water, and then spreading out high above
the sea, setting up a light wind in both directions.</p>

<p>I spent the winter of 1890-91 on the Riviera, between
Hy&egrave;res les Palmiers and Monte Carlo. The weather for
the most part was very fine, and I often had the opportunity
of observing the peculiar phenomena which I had
already noticed in the Atlantic, only on a much smaller
scale. Whereas, in the Atlantic, the glassy zones were
from 8 to 15 miles apart, I often found them not more
than 500 feet apart in the bays of the Mediterranean.
This was most noticeable at Antibes (<a href="#Fig5">Fig. 5</a>), very good
photographs of which I obtained. It will be observed
that the whole surface of the water is streaked like a
block of marble.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>At Nice and Monte Carlo this phenomena was also very
marked. On one occasion, while making observations
from the highest part of the promontory of Monaco on
a perfectly calm day, I noticed that the whole of the sea
presented this peculiar effect as far as the eye could reach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and that the lines which marked the descending air were
never more than 1,000 feet from those which marked the
centre of the ascending column. At about three o&#8217;clock
one afternoon, a large black steamer passed along the coast
in a perfectly straight line, and its wake was at once
marked by a glassy line, which indicated the centre of an
ascending column. This line remained almost straight for
two hours, when finally it became crooked and broken.
The heat of the steamer had been sufficient to determine
this upward current of air.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In 1893 I spent two weeks in the Mediterranean, going
and returning by a slow steamer from Marseilles to Constantinople,
and I had many opportunities of observing
the peculiar phenomena to which I have referred. The
steamer passed over thousands of square miles of calm
sea, the surface being only disturbed by large patches of
small ripples (<a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a>), separated from each other by glassy
streaks, which, however, were not straight as on the
Atlantic, and I found that in no case was the wind
blowing in the same direction on both sides of these
streaks, every one of which indicated the centre of an
ascending or a descending column of air. If we should
investigate these phenomena in what might be called a
dead calm, we should find that the air was rising very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
nearly straight up over the centres of some of these
streaks and descending in a vertical line over the centres
of others. But, as a matter of fact, there is no such thing
as a <i>dead calm</i>. The movement of the air is the resultant
of more than one force. The air is not only rising in some
places and descending in others, but at the same time, the
whole mass is moving forward with more or less rapidity
from one part of the earth to another, so we must consider
that, instead of the air ascending directly from the relatively
hot surface of the earth and descending vertically
in other places, in reality the whole mass of rotating air is
moving horizontally at the same time.</p>

<p>Suppose that the local influence which causes the up and
down motion of the air should be sufficiently great to
cause the air to rise at the rate of 2 miles an hour, and
that the wind at the same time should be blowing at the
rate of 10 miles an hour, the motion of the air would then
be the resultant of these two velocities. In other words,
it would be blowing up an incline of 1 in 5. Suppose,
now, that a bird should be able to so adjust its wings
that it advanced 5 miles in falling 1 mile through a
perfectly calm atmosphere, it would then be able to
sustain itself in an inclined wind, such as I have
described, without any movement at all of its wings.
If it were possible to adjust its wings in such a manner
that it could advance 6 miles by falling through 1 mile
of air, it would then be able to rise as relates to the earth
while in reality falling as relates to the surrounding air.</p>

<p>In conducting a series of experiments with artillery and
small guns on a large and level plain just out of Madrid,
I often observed the same phenomena, as relates to the
wind, that I have already spoken of as having observed
at sea, except that the lines marking the centre of an
ascending or a descending column of air were not so
stationary as they were over the water. It was not an
uncommon thing, when adjusting the sights of a gun to
fire at a target at a very long range, making due allowances
for the wind, to have the wind change and blow in
the opposite direction before the word of command was
given to fire. While conducting these experiments, I often
noticed the flight of eagles. On one occasion a pair of
eagles came into sight on one side of the plain, passed
directly over our heads, and disappeared on the opposite
side. They were apparently always at the same height<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
from the earth, and in soaring completely across the plain
they never once moved their wings. These phenomena, I
think, can only be accounted for on the hypothesis that these
birds were able to feel out with their wings an ascending
column of air, that the centre of this column of air was
approximately a straight line running completely across
the plain, that they found upward movement more than
sufficient to sustain their weight in the air, and that
whereas, as relates to the earth, they were not falling at
all, they were in reality falling some 4 or 5 miles an hour
in the air which supported them.</p>

<p>Again, at Cadiz in Spain, when the wind was blowing
in strongly from the sea, I observed that the sea-gulls
always took advantage of an ascending column of air.
As the wind rose to pass over the fortifications, the gulls
selected a place where they would glide on the ascending
current of air, keeping themselves always approximately
in the same place without any apparent exertion. When,
however, they left this ascending column, it was necessary
for them to work their wings with great vigour until they
again found the proper place to encounter a favourable
current.</p>

<p>I have often noticed that gulls are able to follow a ship
without any apparent exertion; they simply balance themselves
on an ascending column of air, where they seem to
be quite as much at ease as they would have been roosting
on a solid support. If, however, they are driven out of
this position, they generally commence at once to work
their passage. If anything is thrown overboard which is
too heavy for them to lift, the ship soon leaves them
behind, and in order to catch up with it again they move
their wings very much as other birds do; but when once
established in the ascending column of air, they manage
to keep up with the ship by doing little or no work. In
a calm or head wind we find them directly aft of the
ship; if the wind is from the port side they may always
be found on the starboard quarter, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning, while living at Kensington, I
noticed some very curious atmospheric effects. The
weather had been intensely cold for about a week, when
suddenly the atmosphere became warm and very humid.
The earth being much colder than the atmosphere, water
was condensing on everything that it touched. I went
to the bridge over the Serpentine in Hyde Park, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
not disappointed in finding a large number of sea-gulls
waiting about the bridge to be fed. On all ordinary
occasions these birds manage to move about with the
expenditure of very little energy, but on this occasion
every one of them, without a single exception, no matter
in what position he might be, was working his passage
like any other bird, just as I had expected. It is only
on very rare occasions that the surface of the earth is
sufficiently cold as relates to the atmosphere to prevent
all upward currents of air.</p>

<p>Everyone who has passed a winter on the northern
shores of the Mediterranean must have observed the cold
wind which is generally called the mistral. One may be
out driving, the sun may be shining brightly, and the air
warm and balmy, when suddenly, without any apparent
cause, one finds himself in a cold descending wind. This
is the much-dreaded <i>mistral</i>, and if at sea it would be
marked by a glassy line on the surface of the water.
On land, however, there is nothing to render its presence
visible. The ascending column of air is, of course, always
very much warmer than the descending column, and this
is taking place in a greater or lesser degree everywhere
and at all times. A decided upward trend of air is often
encountered by those who are experimenting with kites,
the kite often mounting higher than can be accounted for
on the hypothesis that the wind is moving in a horizontal
direction. I have heard this discussed at considerable
length. When a kite is flown in an upward current, it
behaves in many respects like a soaring bird.</p>

<p>From the foregoing, I think, we may safely draw the
following conclusions<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>First, that there is a constant interchange of air taking
place, the cold air descending, spreading itself out over
the surface of the earth, becoming warm, and ascending
in other places.</p>

<p>Second, that the centres of the two columns are generally
separated from each other by a distance which may be from
500 feet to 20 miles.</p>

<p>Third, that the centres of greatest action are not in
spots, but in lines which may be approximately straight,
but sometimes abound in many sinuosities.</p>

<p>Fourth, that this action is constantly taking place over
both the sea and the land; that the soaring of birds, the
phenomenon which has heretofore been so little understood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
may be accounted for on the hypothesis that the
bird seeks out an ascending column of air, and while
sustaining itself at the same height in the air, without
any muscular exertion, it is in reality falling at a considerable
velocity through the air that surrounds it.</p>

<p>It has been supposed by some scientists that birds may
take advantage of some vibratory or rolling action of the
air. I find, however, from careful observation and experiment,
that the motion of the wind is comparatively steady,
and that the short vibratory or rolling action is always
very near to the earth and is produced by the air flowing
over hills, high buildings, trees, etc.</p>

<p>Tools and instruments used by mechanicians are very
often made of the material most used in their profession;
for instance, a blacksmith&#8217;s tools are generally of iron, a
carpenter&#8217;s tools largely of wood, and a glass-blower uses
many things made of glass, and so on. Mathematicians
are no exception to this general rule, and seem to imagine
that everything can be accomplished by pure mathematical
formul&aelig;.</p>

<p>It appears that Prof. Langley was at times considerably
puzzled by the extraordinary behaviour of birds, and was
led to believe that they took advantage of some vibratory
or oscillating movement of the air; he called it &#8220;the
internal work of the air.&#8221; I have been very much
amused in a recent mathematical work that I have read,
in which the writer seeks to solve all questions by pure
mathematics. In this case, notwithstanding that all of
the factors are unknown and unknowable, still, with the
use of about two pages of closely written algebraic formul&aelig;,
he appears to have solved the whole question. Just how
he arrived at it, however, is more than I am able to understand.</p>

<p>If a kite is flown only a few feet above the ground, it
will be found that the current of air is very unsteady. If
it is allowed to mount to 500 feet the unsteadiness nearly
all disappears, while if it is allowed to mount further to
a height of 1,500 or 2,000 feet, the pull on the cord is
almost constant, and, if the kite is well made, it remains
practically stationary in the air.</p>

<p>I have often noticed in high winds that light and fleecy
clouds come into view, say, about 2,000 feet above the
surface of the earth, and pass rapidly and steadily by
preserving their shape completely. This would certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
indicate that there is no rapid local disturbance in the
air in their immediate vicinity, but that the whole mass
of air in which these clouds are formed is practically
travelling in the same direction and at the same velocity.
Numerous aeronauts have also testified that, no matter
how hard the wind may be blowing, the balloon is always
practically in a dead calm, and if a piece of gold-leaf is
thrown overboard, even in a gale, the gold-leaf and the
balloon never part company in a horizontal direction,
though they may in a vertical direction.</p>

<p>Birds may be divided into two classes. First, the
soaring birds, which practically live upon the wing, and,
by some very delicate sense of touch, are able to feel
the exact condition of the air. Many fish which live
near the top of the water are greatly distressed by
sinking too deeply, while others which live at great
depths are almost instantly killed by being raised to
the surface. The swim-bladder of a fish is in reality a
delicate barometer provided with sensitive nerves which
enable the fish to feel whether it is sinking or rising in
the water. With the surface fish, if the pressure becomes
too great, it involuntarily exerts itself to rise nearer the
surface and so diminish the pressure, and I have no doubt
that the air cells, which are known to be very numerous
and to abound throughout the bodies of birds, are so
sensitive as to enable soaring birds to know at once
whether they are in an ascending or a descending column
of air.</p>

<p>The other class of birds consists of those which only
employ their wings occasionally for the purpose of taking
them rapidly from one place to another. Such birds do
not expend their power so economically as the soaring
birds. They do not pass much of their time in the air,
but what time they are on the wing they put forth an
immense amount of power and fly very rapidly, generally
in a straight line, taking no advantage of air currents.
Partridges, pheasants, wild ducks, geese, and some birds of
passage may be taken as types of this kind. This class
of birds has relatively small wings, and carries about two
and a half times as much weight per square foot of surface
as soaring birds do.</p>

<p>We shall never be able to imitate the flight of the soaring
birds. We cannot hope to make a sensitive apparatus
that will work quick enough to take advantage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
rising currents of air, and he who seeks to fly has this
problem to deal with. A successful flying machine, moving
at a high velocity, is likely at any time to encounter downward
currents of air, which will greatly interfere with its
action. Therefore flying machines must, in the very nature
of things, be provided with sufficient power to propel them
through various currents of air, after the manner of ducks,
partridges, pheasants, etc.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="chapname">FLYING OF KITES.</span></h2>

<p>It was said of Benjamin Franklin that when he wished to
fly a kite in order to ascertain if lightning could be drawn
down from the clouds, he managed to have a boy with him
in order to avoid ridicule. It was considered too frivolous
in those days for grown-up men to amuse themselves with
kites, and a good many besides Benjamin Franklin have
feared to face the ridicule that was inevitable if they
took up or even discussed the question of artificial flight.
Nineteen years ago, when I commenced my own experiments,
I was told that my reputation would be greatly
injured, that mankind looked upon artificial flight as an
<i>ignis-fatuus</i>, and that anyone who experimented in that
direction was placed in the same category as those who
sought to make perpetual-motion machines or to find the
philosopher&#8217;s stone. Although I had little fear of ridicule,
still I kept things as quiet as I could for a considerable
time, and I had been working fully six months before
anyone ascertained what I was doing. When, however,
it became known that I was experimenting with a view
of building a flying machine, the public seemed to think
that I was making honest and praiseworthy scientific
investigations; true, I might not succeed, still it was said
that I would accomplish something, and find out some of
the laws relating to the subject. No one ridiculed my
work except two individuals, and both of these were men
whom I had greatly benefited. As is often the case, those
whom you find in difficulties and place on their feet seek
to do you some injury as compensation for the benefits
they have received.</p>

<p>At the present time it is not necessary for any man to
take a small boy with him as a species of lightning-rod to
ward off ridicule when he flies a kite. I have been one of
a committee on kite-flying at which some of the most
learned and serious men in England were my colleagues
in investigating the subject. The behaviour of kites is
certainly very puzzling to those who do not thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
understand the subject. A kite may be made with the
greatest degree of perfection, and placed in the hands of
one of considerable experience; nevertheless, it may behave
very badly, diving suddenly to the ground without any
apparent cause. Then, again, this same kite will sometimes
steadily mount in the air until it reaches a height difficult
to account for. If the surface of the earth should be
perfectly smooth, and the wind should always blow in a
horizontal direction, kites would not show these eccentric
peculiarities, but, as a matter of fact, the air seldom moves
in a horizontal direction; it is always influenced by the
heat of the surface of the earth. Heated air is continually
ascending in some places only to be cooled and to descend
in other places. If one is attempting to fly a kite where
the air is moving downwards, he will find it an extremely
difficult matter, whereas, if he is fortunate enough to strike
a current of air which is rising, the kite will mount much
higher in the air than can be accounted for, except we
admit of the existence of these upward draughts of air.
On one occasion many years ago, I was present when a
bonded warehouse in New York containing 10,000 barrels
of alcohol was burnt. It was nine o&#8217;clock at night, and
I walked completely around the fire, and found things
just as I had expected. The wind was blowing a perfect
hurricane through every street in the direction of the fire,
although it was a dead calm everywhere else; the flames
mounted straight in the air to an enormous height, and
took with them a large amount of burning wood. When
I was fully 500 feet from the fire, a piece of partly burnt
1-inch board, about 8 inches wide and 4 feet long, fell
through the air and landed very near me, sending sparks
in every direction. This board had evidently been taken
up to a great height by the tremendous uprush of air
caused by the burning alcohol. It is very evident that
a kite made of boiler iron could have been successfully
flown under these conditions providing that it could have
been brought into the right position.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The sketch (<a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a>) shows a device consisting of a spirit
lamp and a box of ice. The lamp heats the metallic plate,
expands the air which rises and is cooled by convection
on coming in contact with the top plate, and descends as
shown. However, a fire is not necessary to accomplish this
result; it is taking place all over the earth, all the time.
A great number of plants depend upon a rising current of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
air to transport their seeds to distant places. Seeds of the
thistle and dandelion variety are sometimes able to travel
hundreds of miles, to the great vexation of farmers; and
there is a certain class of small spider known as &#8220;Balloon
Spiders&#8221; which also depend upon a rising current of air to
carry them from the place of their birth to some distant
part where they, of course, hope to start a colony. When
I was a boy of eight, I noticed small spiders webbing down
from the sky. I was greatly puzzled; it appeared to me
that they had attached their web to some stationary object
high in the air and were spinning a web in order to lower
themselves to the earth. What could that stationary object
be? As the sky was clear, I was quite unable to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
this phenomenon, but afterwards I learned from scientific
books that there was a class of spiders that managed to
rise high in the air by the aid of the wind. It appears
that they climb a high tree until they have reached the
uppermost extremity and then, from a leaf or twig that
projects into the air, they wait for an ascending current of
air. Although the spider is exceedingly small&mdash;the size of
a pin&#8217;s head&mdash;it has about 200 spinnerets, its ordinary web
being formed of no less than that number of extremely fine
threads. These are spun out singly into the air until an
almost invisible mass of fine webs interlacing each other in
all directions and forming an approximately cylindrical
network about half an inch in diameter and 18 inches
long is produced. Whenever an upward draft of air
approximately vertical occurs, it takes this weightless
tangle of fine webs with it, and so soon as the spider finds
there is sufficient pull to lift its weight, it lets go and
ascends with the air. When the Nulli Secundus ascended
at Farnborough and landed at the Crystal Palace, Mr.
Cody, who was on board, reported what he supposed to be
a very curious and unaccountable phenomenon. The
balloon was covered with many thousands of minute
spiders that it had picked up in the air on the voyage.
Certainly this of itself is very strong evidence of the
existence of these ascending currents of air.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>When in Boston about fifteen years ago, I went to Blue
Hill to witness the remarkable kite flying which was
taking place at that time. The kites experimented with
were of the Hargrave type, and of enormous dimensions.
A steel wire and windlass worked by a steam engine was
employed. I was told that on certain occasions the kites
mounted extremely high, much higher than they were able
to account for; but on this particular occasion, although
they let out a great amount of wire, the kite did not mount
very high. I have heard much discussion first and last
regarding the flight of kites, and I think it is generally
admitted that they do sometimes rise upwards and continue
moving to the windward until they pass directly
over the spot where they are attached to the earth. It
was not, however, till about three years ago that I
witnessed this phenomenon myself. Mr. Cody, who is the
inventor of a very good kite, had been flying kites at the
Crystal Palace for some months, and on one occasion I saw
his kite rise, pass to the windward and directly over our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
heads. I took hold of the cord with both hands, and was
somewhat surprised to find what the lifting effect was.
The kite was, however, of large dimensions, but by no
means so large as Mr. Cody&#8217;s &#8220;man-lifting kites.&#8221; In the
drawing (<a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a>) I have shown, at <i>a</i>, the action of a kite in
a horizontal wind, lines <i>e</i>, <i>e</i>, showing the direction of the
wind. A good kite will easily mount 45&deg;, the angle shown,
but on the occasion just mentioned, the sun had been
shining brightly into the valley where the experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
took place, and an upward current of air had been determined.
The cooler air was, of course, rushing in from each
side and mounting in about the centre of the valley, and
Mr. Cody&#8217;s kite, instead of flying in a horizontal wind,
soon reached a point where the wind was ascending at
an angle, as shown at <i>f</i>, <i>f</i>. The kite would therefore
mount until at <i>b</i>, where it presented the same angle
to the wind as with the horizontal wind at <i>a</i>, and
if it should be made to fly at a higher angle, it
might pass over to the position shown at <i>c</i>. But
it must not be imagined that this phenomenon can be
witnessed every day in the year. It is only on rare
occasions that one is fortunate enough to find a wind
which is blowing at a sufficiently sharp upward trend to
cause a kite to pass to the windward over the point of
support. Neither must it be supposed that this favourable
condition of things is of long duration. As the centre of
the upward current is constantly moving, it is certain that
very soon it will move away from the point from which
the kite is being flown. What is true of kites is also true
of flying machines. It is very difficult indeed to make a
kite mount providing that it is in a descending current of
air, and one is just as likely to find a descending current
as any other. Flying machines will, therefore, have to be
made with a considerable amount of reserve energy, so as
to be able to put on a spurt when they encounter an
adverse current. If a machine is made that is able to
maintain itself in the air for any considerable length of
time, it will not be a very difficult task to know when a
current of air of this kind is encountered, because, if the
engine is working up to speed, and everything is in perfect
order, and still the machine is falling, it is very certain
that an unfavourable current has been encountered, and
efforts should be made to get out of it as soon as possible.
Then, again, if the machine has an abnormal tendency to
rise without any increase in the number of rotations made
by the screws, the aeronaut may be certain that he has
encountered an upward and favourable current of air
which, unfortunately, will not last. It should, however,
be borne in mind that, while the width of the upward
current is not very great, nevertheless, it may extend in a
practically straight line for many miles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="chapname">PRINCIPALLY RELATING TO SCREWS.</span></h2>

<p>In 1887 I was approached by several wealthy gentlemen
who asked me if I thought it was possible to make a
flying machine. I said, &#8220;certainly; the domestic goose
is able to fly and why should not man be able to do as
well as a goose?&#8221; They then asked me what it would
cost and how long it would take, and, without a moment&#8217;s
hesitation, I said it would require my undivided attention
for five years and might cost &pound;100,000. A great deal of
experimenting would be necessary; the first three years
would be devoted to developing an internal combustion
engine of the Brayton or Otto type, and the next two
years to experimenting with aeroplanes and screws and
building a machine. Even at that time I had a clear idea
of the system that would be the best. However, nothing
was then done, but in 1889 I employed for the purpose
two very skilful American mechanics, and put them to
work at Baldwyn&#8217;s Park, Kent. At that time the
petroleum motor had not been reduced to its present
degree of efficiency and lightness; it was not suitable
for a flying machine, and I saw that it would require
a lot of experimental work in order to develop it. After
taking into consideration all the facts of the case, I decided
to use a steam engine. Had I been able to obtain the
light and efficient motors which have been recently
developed, thanks to the builders of racing cars, I
should not have had to experiment at all with engines
and boilers, as I could have obtained the necessary motors
at once. As it was, I was obliged to content myself with
the steam engine.</p>

<p>I found that there was a great deal of misunderstanding
regarding the action of aeroplanes, and also of screws
working in the air. I procured all the literature available
on the subject, both English and French, and
attempted to make a thorough study of the question;
but I was not satisfied, on account of the wide difference
in the views of the writers and the conflicting formul&aelig;
that were employed. I therefore decided to make experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
myself, and to ascertain what could be done without
the use of anybody&#8217;s formula. Although this was nearly
twenty years ago, I find that there is still a great deal of
discussion regarding the action of aeroplanes and screws,
in which the majority taking part in the discussion are in
the wrong. However, several good works on the subject
have recently been published.</p>

pitch throughout, the middle screw has increasing pitch, and the left

</div>
</div>

<p>Having designed and put my boiler and engine in hand,
I commenced a series of experiments for the purpose of
ascertaining the efficiency of screw propellers working
in the air, and the form and size that would be best for
my proposed machine. The illustration <a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a> shows a
photographic group of the screws and other objects with
which I experimented. <a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a> shows some of the leading
types which, as will be seen, have blades of different shape,
pitch, and size. <a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a> shows three of the best screws
employed. It will be observed that one has uniform pitch,
another increasing pitch, and the third compound increasing
pitch. In order to test the efficiency of my screws I made
the apparatus shown in <a href="#Fig12">Fig. 12</a>. The power for running
the screw was transmitted by means of a belt to the
straight cylindrical pulley <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>. Shaft <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> was of steel,
rather small in diameter, and ran smoothly, and practically
without friction, through the two bearings <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>. When
the first screw, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, was run at a high velocity, the axial
thrust pushed the shaft <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> back and elongated the spiral
spring <i>e</i>. The degree of screw thrust was indicated in
pounds by the pointer <i>g</i>. The power was transmitted
through a very accurate and sensitive dynamometer, so
that the amount consumed could be easily observed by
a pointer similar to the one employed for indicating the
screw thrust. A tachometer was also employed to observe
the number of turns that the screw was making in a
minute. The whole apparatus was carefully and accurately
made and worked exceedingly well. I was thus enabled,
with my various forms of screws and other objects, to
make very accurate measurements, some of which are
exceedingly interesting.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 13.&mdash;Apparatus for testing the direction of air currents caused by a
rapidly rotating screw. Silken threads were attached to the wire <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>,
which indicated clearly the direction in which the air was moving.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In many of the treatises and books of that time it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a><br /><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
stated that a screw propeller, working in the air, was
exceedingly wasteful of energy on account of producing
a fan-blower action. Some inventors suggested that the
screw should work in a stationary cylinder, or, better
still, that the whole screw should be encased in a rotating
cylinder, to prevent this outward motion of the air. In
order to ascertain what the actual facts were, I attached
a large number of red silk threads to a brass wire, which
I placed completely around my screw (see <a href="#Fig13">Fig. 13</a>). Upon
starting up I found that, instead of the air being blown
out at the periphery of the screw, it was in reality sucked
in, as will be seen in the illustration. I was rather surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to see how sharp a line of demarkation there was
between the air that was moving in the direction of the
screw and the air that was moving in the opposite
direction. The screw employed in these experiments was
18 inches in diameter and had a pitch of 24 inches. It
was evident, however, if the pitch of the screw was coarse
enough that there would be a fan-blower action. I therefore
tried screws of various degrees of pitch, and found
when the pitch was a little more than three times the
diameter, giving to the outer end of the blade an angle
of 45&deg;, that a fan-blower action was produced&mdash;that is,
part of the time when the screw was running, the air
would alternate; sometimes it would pass inwards at the
periphery and sometimes outwards. The change of direction,
however, was always indicated by a difference in
the pitch of the note given out, and also by the thrust.
In <a href="#Fig14">Fig. 14</a> I have shown the extremities of the blades of
some of the different forms of screws experimented with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in which <i>a</i> shows a plain screw, the front side being
straight and of equal pitch from the periphery to the
hub; <i>b</i> is a screw of practically the same pitch, but
slightly curved so as to give what is known as an
increasing pitch; <i>c</i> shows the extremity of a screw in
which the curve is not the same throughout&mdash;that is, it
is what is known as a compound increasing pitch; <i>d</i> is
the shape of the screw that gave the angle of 45&deg; above
referred to.</p>

increasing pitch; <i>d</i>, end of screw blade 45&deg;; <i>e</i>, screw with very thick
blade; <i>f</i>, blade with no pitch at all; <i>g</i>, blade which gave a thrust in
the direction of the convex side, no matter in which direction it was
revolved; <i>h</i>, screw said to have been used in the French Government
experiments.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first screw experimented with was <i>a</i>. This screw
was run at a high velocity&mdash;about 2,500 revolutions per
minute&mdash;until a screw thrust of 14 lbs. was obtained, and
then the governor of the engine was set so that all screws
of the same diameter could be run at the same speed.
Wishing to ascertain the efficiency of the screw and how
much was lost in skin friction, I multiplied the thrust in
pounds by the pitch of the screw in feet and by the
number of turns it was making in a minute. This, of
course, gave the exact number of foot-pounds in energy
that was being imparted to the air. I was somewhat
surprised to find that it corresponded exactly with the
readings of the dynamometer. I thought at first that
I must have made some mistake. Again I went very
carefully over all the figures, tested everything, and
made another experiment and found, even if I changed
the number of revolutions, that the readings of the
dynamometer were always exactly the same as the
energy imparted to the air. This seemed to indicate
that the screw was working very well and that the skin
friction must be very small indeed. In order to test this,
I made what we will call, for the moment, a screw without
any pitch at all&mdash;that is, the blades were of wood and of
the exact thickness and width of the blades of the screw <i>a</i>,
but without any pitch at all. The extremity of the blade
is shown at <i>f</i>. I placed this screw on my machine in place
of <i>a</i>, and although my dynamometer was so sensitive that
the pointer would move away from the zero pin by simply
touching the tip of the finger to the shaft, it failed to
indicate, and thus the screw appeared to consume no power
at all. These experiments were repeated a considerable
number of times. I then obtained a sheet of tin the same
diameter as the screws, 18 inches, and upon running it at
the same speed, I found that it did consume a measurable
amount of power, certainly more than the two blades <i>f</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
This no doubt was due to the uneven surface of the tin.
Had it been a well-made saw blade without teeth, perfectly
smooth and true on both sides, it probably would not have
required power enough to have shown on the dynamometer.
However, it is quite possible that there is a little more
skin friction with a polished metallic surface, than with a
piece of smooth evenly lacquered wood. The screws which
I employed were of American white pine such as used by
patternmakers. This wood was free from blemishes of all
kind, extremely light, uniform, and strong. When the
screw had been formed, it was varnished on both sides with
a solution of hot glue, which greatly increased the strength
of the wood crosswise of the grain. When this glue was
thoroughly dry, the wood was sand-papered until it was as
smooth as glass; the whole thing was then carefully varnished
with shellac, rubbed down again and revarnished
with very thin shellac something like lacquer. In this way
the surface of the screw was made very smooth. The screws,
of course, were made with a great degree of accuracy and
as free as possible from any unevenness. Having tested
screw <i>a</i>, I next tested screw <i>b</i>. I found with the same
number of revolutions per minute that this screw produced
more thrust, but it required more power to run it, and
when the energy imparted to the air was compared with
the readings of the dynamometer, it was found that it did
not do quite so well as <i>a</i>; still as the thrust was greater and
the efficiency only slightly less, it appeared to be the better
screw. Upon trying screw <i>c</i>, under the same conditions,
the thrust was very much increased, but the power
required was also increased to a still greater degree, showing
that this form was not so favourable as either <i>a</i> or <i>b</i>.
All the screws experimented with had very thin blades,
and it occurred to me that the difference between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
might arise from the fact that, when <i>a</i> was running at a
very high velocity, the working side instead of being flat
might have become convex to a slight extent, whereas with
<i>b</i>, a slight bending back of the edges of the blade would
still leave the working side concave. I therefore made
the screw shown at <i>e</i>, which had the same pitch as the
other three, but the working side was of the same shape as
<i>a</i>. Of course the additional thickness of the blades made
it impossible to give an easy curve to the back. Curiously
enough I found that <i>e</i> did nearly as well as <i>a</i>, and quite as
well as <i>b</i>. The additional thickness did not interfere to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
any appreciable extent with its efficiency. I then made
another propeller, shown at <i>g</i>, which was of the same
thickness in the middle as <i>e</i>. Upon running this, I found
that it required considerable power, and no matter which
way it was run, the thrust was always in the direction of
the convex side, which was quite the reverse from what
one would have naturally supposed.</p>

<p class="capcenter">Fig. 15.&mdash;The manner of building up the large screws.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>About the time that I was making these experiments,
my duties called me to Paris, and while there I called on
my old friend Gaston Tissandier. Through his influence I
was permitted to see some models of the screws that were
alleged to have been used by Captain Renard in his
experiments for the French Government, and I was somewhat
surprised to find the form of the blades, the same as
shown at <i>h</i>, <a href="#Fig14">Fig. 14</a>, and completely without any twist.
On my return to England, I made a screw of this description.
It is also shown in the photographic illustration,
<a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a>. Upon testing this screw, I found that its efficiency
was only 40 per cent. of that of <i>a</i>&mdash;that is, the energy or
acceleration imparted to the air was only 40 per cent. of
the readings of the dynamometer. It then occurred to me
that this particular form of screw was probably the one
that the French had for exhibition purposes, but not the one
they intended to use. Having tried all the various forms
of screws and other objects shown in <a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a>, I made some
sheet metal screws; also a screw which consisted of a steel
frame covered with woven fabric, and which was identical
with screws that I had seen described in various works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
relating to aerial navigation. It was found quite impossible
to keep the fabric taut and smooth, and the results
were very bad indeed, it being only 40 per cent. as
efficient as a well-made wooden screw.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig16">

<div class="capdiv">
<p class="capcenter">Fig. 16.&mdash;A fabric-covered screw with a very low efficiency.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having thus ascertained the best form of a screw, I
built up my first large screws, which were 17 feet 10
inches in diameter, after the well-known manner of making
wooden patterns for casting steamship propellers. <a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a>
shows the form of the end of the blade, the middle of the
blade, and the hub. My first pair of large screws had
a pitch of 24 feet, but these were too great a drag
on the engine. I therefore made another pair with 16 feet
pitch which greatly increased the piston speed, and
permitted the engines to develop much more power; the
screw thrust was also increased just in an inverse ratio
to the pitch of the screws. Another pair of screws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was tried with 14 feet pitch and 12 feet in diameter,
but these did not do so well. My large screws were
made with a great degree of accuracy; they were perfectly
smooth and even on both sides, the blades being thin and
held in position by a strip of rigid wood on the back of
the blade. In order to prevent the thrust from collapsing
the blades, wires were extended backwards and attached
to a prolongation of the shaft. Like the small screws,
they were made of the very best kind of seasoned
American white pine, and when finished were varnished
on both sides with hot glue. When this was thoroughly
dry, they were sand-papered again and made perfectly
smooth and even. The blades were then covered with
strong Irish linen fabric of the smoothest and best make.
Glue was used for attaching the fabric, and when dry
another coat of glue was applied, the surface rubbed down
again and then painted with zinc white in the ordinary
way and varnished. These screws worked exceedingly
well. I had means of ascertaining, with a great degree of
accuracy, the thrust of the screw, the number of turns per
minute, the speed of the machine, and, in fact, all the events
that were taking place on the machine. It was found
that when the screw thrust in pounds was multiplied by
the pitch in feet, and by the number of revolutions made
in a minute of time, it exactly corresponded to the power
that the engines were developing, and that the amount of
loss in skin friction was so small as to be practically
negligible.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 17.&mdash;The hub and one of the blades of the screw on the Farman
machine. The blade <i>c</i>, is a sheet of metal riveted to the rod <i>b</i>, and
forms a projection on the back of the blade which greatly reduces
its efficiency. The peculiar form of hub employed makes it possible
to change the diameter and pitch of this screw at will.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In connection with this subject I would say that many
experimenters claim to have shown that the skin friction
on screws is considerable, in fact, so great as to be a very
important factor in the equation of flight. I am, however,
of the opinion that these experimenters have not had well-made
screws. If the surface of the screw is uneven,
irregular, or rough, a considerable amount of energy is lost,
as shown in the French screw and the fabric covered
screw. It is simply a question of having a screw well-made.
In those recently employed in France (see <a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>),
the blades are of hammered sheet metal, the twist is not
uniform or true, and what is worst of all, the arm <i>b</i>
projects on the back of the blade and offers a good deal of
resistance to the air. This form of screw, however, is very
ingenious; as will be seen by the drawing, the pitch and
diameter can be changed at will. It is, however, heavy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
wasteful of power, and altogether too small for the work
it has to do. The skin friction of screws in a steamship
has led inventors to suppose that the same laws relate to
screws running in air, but such is by no means the case.
In designing a steamship, we have to make a compromise
in regard to the size of the screw. If the screw is too
small, an increase in diameter is, of course, an advantage,
and it may also be an advantage, not only to increase the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43<br />44]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
diameter, but also to reduce the pitch; however, a point
is soon reached where the skin friction will more than
neutralise the advantages of engaging a larger volume of
water. This is because the water adheres to the surface;
in fact, the skin friction of a ship and its screw consumes
fully 80 per cent. of the total power of the engines, but
with an air propeller its surface is not wetted and the air
does not stick to its surface. If made of polished wood,
the friction is so extremely small as to be almost unmeasurable.
The diameter of a well-made screw running in air is
therefore not limited in any degree by skin friction, as is
the case with a screw running in water; in fact, it is rather
a question of its weight, and its efficiency ought to increase
in direct ratio with its diameter, because the area of the
disc increases with the square of the diameter. The screw
slip is therefore reduced by one-half by simply doubling
the diameter of the screw. It will be understood that by
doubling the diameter of the screw, four times as much air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45<br />46]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
will be engaged. If we push this back at half the speed,
we shall have the same screw thrust, because the resistance
of the air is in proportion to the square of the velocity
that we impart to it, so that one just balances the other,
and the diminution of wasteful slip is just in proportion to
the increase in diameter. In all cases, the screw should be
made as large as possible.</p>

<p>In the drawing (<a href="#Fig18">Fig. 18</a>) I have shown screw blades of
a proper shape to give the best results&mdash;that is, providing a
metallic screw is employed. Instead of having the arm of
the screw on the back of the blade to offer resistance to the
air, the arm should be tubular, flattened, and covered on
both sides with sheet metal. This particular formation not
only prevents the air from striking the arm, but, at the
same time, prevents the pressure of the air from deforming
the blade, so, if a metallic screw is to be used, the
form of blade which I have shown will be found much
superior to that employed at the present time on continental
flying machines. We should not lose sight of the fact that
weight tells very seriously against the success of a flying
machine, and that no expense should be spared to reduce
the weight, providing that it is possible to do so without
reducing the factor of safety. Suppose, for example, that
we use an ordinary hub secured to a solid shaft by a
common key. All the parts have to be made heavy in
order to be sufficiently strong to withstand the strain. In
the drawing (<a href="#Fig20">Fig. 20</a>) I have shown a hub which I think is
quite as light and strong as it is possible to make it. The
action of the motor is often spasmodic and puts very great
strain upon the parts, and there is a very strong tendency
for the shaft to turn round in the hub. If a key is used,
the hub has to be large and strong, and the key of considerable
size, otherwise the parts would be deformed. In
my own experiments, I have found considerable difficulty
in securing a shaft to wooden screws. However, it will be
seen in the drawings that a series of grooves is cut in the
shaft and that the hub has internal projections, so that the
one fits the other. This makes a very strong connection
and is of extreme lightness. Both the hub and the shaft
should be of tempered steel. The spokes should be hard
drawn steel tubes with long fine threads, so as to withstand
centrifugal force. To prevent them from rotating in
the hub, the nuts <i>d</i>, <i>d</i> are provided, which compress the
arms of the steel hub so as to grip the tube with any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
degree of force required. It will be seen that with this
system the pitch of the screw may be adjusted to some
extent; however, it is better to have all parts of the screw,
from hub to centre, of the same pitch. A slight deviation
from this is admissible in the experimental stage, so long
as the deviation from a true screw, caused by rotating the
arm, is not greater than one half of the slip while in flight.</p>

<p>Many experimenters have imagined that a screw is just
as efficient placed in front of a machine as at the rear, and
it is quite probable that, in the early days of steamships, a
similar state of things existed. For several years there
were steamboats running on the Hudson River, New York,
with screws at their bows instead of at their stern. Inventors
of, and experimenters with, flying machines are not
at all agreed by any means in regard to the best position
for the screw. It would appear that many, having noticed
that a horse-propelled carriage always has the horse
attached to the front, and that the carriage is drawn instead
of pushed, have come to the conclusion that, in a
flying machine, the screw ought, in the very nature of
things, to be attached to the front of the machine, so as to
draw it through the air. Railway trains have their
propelling power in front, and why should it not be the
same with flying machines? But this is very bad reasoning.
There is but one place for the screw, and that is in the
immediate wake, and in the centre of the greatest atmospheric
disturbance. While a machine is running, although
there is a marked difference between water and air as far
as skin friction is concerned, still the conditions are the
same as far as the <i>position</i> of the screw is concerned.
With a well-designed steamship, the efficiency of the screw
is so great as to be almost unbelievable; in fact, if a
steamship had never been made, and the design of one
should be placed before the leading mathematicians of to-day,
with the request that they should compute the
efficiency of the screw, none of them would come anywhere
near the mark. They would make it altogether too small.
As before stated, when a steamship is being driven through
the water, the water adheres to its sides and is moved
forward by the ship&mdash;that is, it has acceleration imparted to
it which exactly corresponds to the power consumed in
driving the ship through the water. This, of course,
retards it and we find in a well-designed ship, not run
above its natural speed, that about 80 per cent. of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
power of the engine is consumed in skin friction, or in
imparting a forward motion to the water. Suppose that
we should take such a ship, remove the screw, and tow it
through the water with a very long wire rope at a
speed of, say, 20 miles an hour; we should find that the
water at the stern of the ship was moving forward at a
velocity of fully 6 miles an hour&mdash;that is, travelling in the
same direction as the ship. By replacing the screw, and
applying engine power sufficient to give the ship the same
speed of 20 miles an hour, identical results would be
produced. The skin friction still impels the water forward,
so that the screw, instead of running in stationary water,
is actually running in water moving in the same direction
as the ship at a velocity of 6 miles an hour. If the slip
of the screw should only be equal to this forward motion,
the apparent slip would be nothing; in fact, the ship
would be moving just as fast as it would move if the
screw were running in a solid nut instead of in the
yielding water. Curiously enough there have been cases
of negative slip in which the actual slip of the screw in the
water was less than the forward movement of the water,
and in such cases a ship is said to have negative slip. A
very noticeable case of this kind occurred in the Royal
Navy in the sixties.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I was at the time engaged in a large
shipbuilding establishment in New York, and remember
distinctly the interest that the case created amongst the
draughtsmen and engineers of that establishment. Of
course, this apparently impossible phenomenon created a
great deal of discussion on both sides of the Atlantic. It
appears that this ship had been built under an Admiralty
Specification which called for a screw of a certain diameter
and pitch with a specified number of revolutions per
minute, and for a certain number of knots per hour, also
that the boiler pressure should not go above a certain
number of pounds per square inch. When the ship was
finished and went on her trial trip, it was found impossible
to make the full number of turns called for in the specification
with the boiler pressure allowable; nevertheless,
the speed was greater than the specification called for, and
as speed was the desideratum, and not the number of
revolutions, the contractors thought their ship should be
accepted. Then arose a discussion as to the diameter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
pitch of the screw. It was claimed that a mistake must
have occurred. A careful measurement was made in the
dry dock, and all was found correct. Once more the ship
was tried, and again her speed was in excess of the specification,
notwithstanding that it was still impossible to get
the specified number of revolutions per minute. Mathematicians
then took the matter in hand, and it was found
that the ship actually travelled faster than she would have
done if the screw had been running in a solid nut.
Instead of a positive slip, the screw had in reality a
negative slip; but this was not believed at the time, and
the discussion and controversy continued. The ship was
tried again and again, and always with the same results.
This apparently inexplicable phenomenon was accounted
for in the following manner:&mdash;The hull of the ship was
said to be rather imperfect and to cause a considerable
drag in the water, so that, when the ship was moving at
full speed, the water at the stern had imparted to it a
forward velocity greater than the actual slip.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The particulars relating to this event are taken from accounts
published at the time in American papers.</p></div>

<p>What is true of ships is true of flying machines. Good
results can never be obtained by placing the screw in front
instead of in the rear of the machine. If the screw is in
front, the backwash strikes the machine and certainly has
a decidedly retarding action. The framework, motor, etc.,
offer a good deal of resistance to the passage of the air,
and if the air has already had imparted to it a backward
motion, the resistance is greatly increased. The framework
will always require a considerable amount of energy to
drive it through the air, and the whole of this energy is
spent in imparting a forward motion to the air, so if we
place the propelling screw at the rear of the machine
in the centre of the greatest atmospheric resistance,
it will recover a portion of the lost energy, as in the
steamship referred to. It will, therefore, be seen that
when the screw is at the rear, it is running in air which
is already moving forward with a considerable velocity,
which reduces the slip of the screw in a corresponding
degree. I have made experiments with a view of proving
this, which I shall mention further on, and which ought to
leave no chance for future discussion.</p>

being subjected to an air blast in order to test its lifting effect as
compared with its tendency to travel with the blast.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>My first experiments had shown that wooden aeroplanes
did much better than any of the fabric covered aeroplanes
that I was able to make at that time, but as wood was
quite out of the question on my large machine on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of its weight, it was necessary for me to conduct experiments
with a view of ascertaining the relative values of
different fabrics. For this purposes, I made the little
apparatus shown (<a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a>). This was connected to a fan
blower driven by a steam engine having a governor that
worked directly on the point of cut-off. The speed was,
therefore, quite uniform and the blast of air practically
constant. I had a considerable number of little frames cut
out of sheet steel, and to these I attached various kinds of
fabric, such as ordinary satin, white silk, closely woven
silk, linen, various kinds of woollen fabrics, including some
very coarse tweeds, also glass-paper, tracing linen, and the
best quality of Spencer&#8217;s balloon fabric. The blast of air
was not large enough to cover the whole surface of the
aeroplanes, so that the character of the back of the frames
was of no account. The first object experimented with
was a smooth piece of tin. When this was placed at an
angle of 1 in 14, it was found that the drift or tendency to
travel in the direction of the blast was just one-fourteenth
part of the upward tendency, or lift. This was exactly
as it should have been. Upon changing the angle to
1 in 10, a similar thing occurred; the lift was ten times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a><br /><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the drift. I, therefore, considered the results obtained
with the sheet of tin as unity, and gave to every other
material experimented with, a coefficient of the unity thus
established. Upon testing a frame covered with tightly-drawn
white silk, a considerable amount of air passed
through, and with an angle of 1 in 14, the lift was only
about double the drift. A piece of very open fabric,
a species of buckram, was next tried, and with this the
lift and drift were about equal. With closely-woven,
shiny satin the coefficient was about &middot;80; with a piece
of ordinary sheeting the coefficient was &middot;90; with closely-woven,
rough tweeds, &middot;70; and with glass-paper about &middot;75.
With a piece of tracing linen very tightly drawn, results
were obtained identical with those of a sheet of tin, and
with Spencer&#8217;s balloon fabric the coefficient was about &middot;99.
I, therefore, decided to cover my aeroplanes with this
material. It will be observed that the apparatus is so
arranged that both the lift and the drift can be easily
measured.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain the resistance encountered by
various shaped bodies driven at various speeds through
the air, the best form of aeroplanes, and the efficiency of
atmospheric condensers, I made the apparatus shown in
<a href="#Fig22">Figs. 22</a> and <a href="#Fig23">23</a>. The smaller and straight portion of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
apparatus was 12 feet long and exactly 3 feet square
inside, and was connected as shown to a shorter box
4 feet square. Two strongly made wooden screws <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>
and <i>d</i>, were attached to the same shaft. These screws
had two blades each, and while one pair of blades was in
a vertical position, the other was in a horizontal position.
I interposed between the screws, slats of thin wood
arranged in the manner shown at <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>; this was to
prevent rotation of the air. At <i>e</i> I placed vertical slats
of thin wood, and horizontal slats of the same size at <i>f</i>.
At <i>g</i> two wide and thin boards,
sharp at both edges and made in
the form of the letter X, were
placed in the box as shown in
section XY. An engine of 100
H.P. with an automatic variable
cut-off was employed which gave
to the screws a uniform rate of
rotation, and as the engine had
no other work to do, the governor
could be arranged to give varying
speeds such as were required for
the experiments. The objects to
be tested were attached to the
movable bars. In the drawing,
the aeroplane <i>k</i>, <i>k</i> is shown in
position for testing. This apparatus
was provided with a rather
complicated set of levers, which
permitted not only the measurement
of the lift of the objects
experimented with, but also that
of the drift. The principle employed
in this apparatus was a
modification of the ordinary weighing apparatus used by
grocers, etc. The first object tested was a bar of wood
exactly 2 inches square shown in <a href="#Fig24">Fig. 24</a>. This was placed
in such a manner that the wind struck squarely against the
side as shown in the drawing, and with a wind of 49 miles
per hour, it was found that the drift or tendency to move
with the air was 5&middot;16 lbs.; at the same time, the wind
on my instrument gave a pressure of 2 lbs. on a normal
plane 6 inches square. The velocity of the wind was
ascertained by an anemometer of the best London make.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Upon turning the same bar of wood in the position shown
at <i>b</i>, the drift mounted to 5&middot;47 lbs. A round bar of wood,
2 inches in diameter, shown at <i>c</i>, gave a drift of 2&middot;97 lbs.
These experiments were repeated with a wind velocity of
40 miles per hour, when it was found that the drift of <i>a</i>
was 4&middot;56 lbs., and that of the round bar, 2&middot;80 lbs. It will
be seen from these experiments that the power required
for driving bars or rods through the air is considerably
greater than one would have supposed. The next object
experimented with was <i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig25">Fig. 25</a>. When this was subject
to a wind of 40 miles an hour, the drift was 0&middot;78 lb.
Upon reversing this bar&mdash;that is, putting the thin edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
instead of the thick edge next to the wind&mdash;the drift
mounted to 1&middot;22 lbs.; <i>b</i> showed a drift of 0&middot;28 lb. with
the thick edge to the wind, and 0&middot;42 lb. with the thin
edge to the wind; <i>c</i> showed a drift of 0&middot;23 lb. with the
thick edge to the wind, and 0&middot;59 lb. with the thin edge to
the wind; and <i>d</i>, which was the same thickness as the
others and 12 inches wide, both edges being alike, showed
a drift of only 0&middot;19 lb. These experiments show in a
most conclusive manner the shapes that are most advantageous
to use in constructing the framework of flying
machines. Aeroplane <i>e</i>, <a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a>, when placed on the
machine in a horizontal position showed neither lift nor
drift, but upon placing it at an angle of 1 in 20, as shown
at <i>f</i>, the lift was 3&middot;98 lbs. and the drift 0&middot;30 lb. with
a wind velocity of 40 miles per hour. At this low angle
the blade trembled slightly. Upon placing the same plane
at an angle of 1 in 16 as shown at <i>g</i>, the lift was 4&middot;59 lbs.
and the drift 0&middot;53 lb. It will be observed that the
underneath side of this plane is perfectly flat. The next
experiment was with planes slightly curved, as shown in
<a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>. The aeroplane <i>a</i> was 16 inches wide, very thin,
and only slightly curved. When set at a very low angle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
it vibrated so as to make the readings very uncertain,
but when set at an angle of 1 in 10 it lifted 9&middot;94 lbs.
with a drift of 1&middot;12 lbs. By slightly changing the angle
it was made to lift 10&middot;34 lbs. with a drift of 1&middot;23 lbs.,
the wind velocity being 41 miles per hour. Aeroplane <i>b</i>,
12 inches wide, <a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>, when placed at an angle of 1 in 14
with an air blast of 41 miles per hour, gave a lift of
5&middot;28 lbs. with a drift of 0&middot;44 lb.; at an angle of 1 in 12
the lift was 5&middot;82 lbs. and the drift 0&middot;5 lb.; at an angle of
1 in 10 the lift was 6&middot;75 lbs. and the drift 0&middot;73 lb.; with an
angle of 1 in 8 the lift was 7&middot;75 lbs. and the drift 1 lb.;
with an angle of 1 in 7 the lift was 8&middot;5 lbs. and the drift
1&middot;25 lbs.; at an angle of 1 in 6 the lift was 9&middot;87 lbs. and
the drift 1&middot;71 lbs. Aeroplane <i>c</i>, <a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>, which had more
curvature than <i>b</i>, when run in a horizontal position, gave
a considerable lift, and when raised to an angle of 1 in 12
it gave a lift of 6&middot;12 lbs. with a drift of 0&middot;54 lb. In
another experiment at the same angle, it gave a lift of
6&middot;41 lbs. with a drift of 0&middot;56 lb.; at an angle of 1 in 16 it
gave a lift of 5&middot;47 lbs. with a drift of 0&middot;37 lb.; at an angle
of 1 in 10 it gave a lift of 6&middot;97 lbs. and a drift of 0&middot;70 lb.;
at an angle of 1 in 8 it gave a lift of 8&middot;22 lbs. with a drift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of 1&middot;08 lbs.; at an angle of 1 in 7 it gave a lift of 9&middot;94 lbs.
with a drift of 1&middot;45 lbs.; at an angle of 1 in 6 it gave a lift
of 10&middot;34 lbs. and a drift of 1&middot;75 lbs. This plane was then
carefully set so that both the forward and aft edges were
exactly the same height, and with a wind blast of 41 miles
per hour it gave a lift of 2&middot;09 lbs. with a drift of 0&middot;21 lb.
It was then pitched 1 in 18 in the wrong direction, and at
this point, the lifting effect completely disappeared, while
the drift was practically nothing.</p>

<p>It will be seen by this that the various members constituting
the frame of a flying machine should not be
placed in close proximity to each other.</p>

<p>A bar of wood similar in shape to <i>d</i> (<a href="#Fig25">Fig. 25</a>), but being
9 inches wide instead of 12 inches, was mounted in a wind
blast of 41 miles an hour, with the front edge 3&middot;31 inches
above the rear edge, and this showed a lift of 7&middot;08 lbs. and
a drift of 3&middot;23 lbs. When the angle was reduced to 2&middot;31
inches, it gave a lift of 4&middot;53 lbs. with a drift of 0&middot;78 lb.,
and with the angle reduced to 1&middot;31 inches, the lift was
3&middot;37 lbs. and the drift 0&middot;5 lb. It will, therefore, be seen
that even objects rounded on both sides give a very fair
lift, and in designing the framework of machines advantage
should be taken of this knowledge. The bar of wood <i>c</i>
(<a href="#Fig25">Fig. 25</a>) was next experimented with. With the sharp
edge to the wind, and with the front edge 2 inches higher
than the rear edge, the lift was 2&middot;54 lbs. and the drift 0&middot;76
lb. By turning it about so that the wind struck the thick
edge, the lift was 4&middot;45 lbs. and the drift 0&middot;47 lb. This
seemed rather remarkable, but, as it actually occurred, I
mention it for other people to speculate upon. It, however,
indicates that we should take advantage of all these
peculiarities of the air in constructing the framework of a
machine, which in itself is extremely important, as I find
that a very large percentage of the energy derived from
the engines is consumed in forcing the framework through
the air. It is quite true that a certain amount of this
energy may be recovered by the screw, provided that the
screw runs in the path occupied by the framework. Still,
it is much better that the framework should be so constructed
as to offer the least possible resistance to the air,
and, as far as possible, all should be made to give a lifting
effect.</p>

shape and arrangement of tubes shown at <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, although effective as

</div>
</div>

<p>Having ascertained the lifting effect of wooden aeroplanes
of various forms and at varying velocities of the
wind, and, also, the resistance offered by various bodies
driven through the air, I next turned my attention to the
question of condensation. I wished to recover as much
water as possible from my exhaust steam. I had already
experimented with Mr. Horatio Philipps&#8217; sustainers, and I
found that their lifting effect was remarkable. A curious
thing about these aeroplanes was that they gave an
appreciable lift when the front edge was rather lower than
the rear. I therefore determined to take advantage of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
peculiar phenomenon, and to make my condenser tubes as
far as possible in the shape of Mr. Philipps&#8217; sustainers.
<a href="#Fig30">Fig. 30</a> shows a section of one of these tubes, in which <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>
is the top surface, <i>b</i> a soldered joint, and <i>c</i> the steam space.
These were mounted on a frame as shown at <i>a</i> (<a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>).
I had already found that bodies placed near to each other
offered an increased resistance to the air, but by placing
these sustainers in the manner shown this was avoided, as
the air had sufficient space to pass through without being
either driven forward or compressed. It was found by
experiment that the arrangement of tubes or sustainers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
shown at <i>d</i>, <i>d</i> (<a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>), was very efficient as a condenser,
but it gave a very heavy drift and no lifting effect at
all; whereas, on the other hand, the arrangement shown
at <i>a</i> was equally efficient, and, at the same time, gave a
decided lifting effect. When twelve of these tubes or
sustainers were placed at an angle of 1 in 12, the lifting
effect was 12&middot;63 lbs. and the drift 2&middot;06 lbs. It was found,
however, that a good deal of the drift was due to the wind
getting at the framework that was used for holding the
sustainers in position. With a wind velocity of 40 miles
an hour and a temperature of 62&deg; F., 2&middot;25 lbs. of water
were condensed in five minutes, and, while running, the
back edge of the sustainers was quite cool. At another
trial of the same arrangement under the same conditions,
the lift was 11 lbs. and the drift 2&middot;63 lbs. It is quite
possible on this occasion that the metal was so extremely
thin that the angles were not always maintained; consequently,
that no two readings would be alike. It was
found at this point that the belt was slipping, and a larger
pulley was put on the driving shaft of the screws; and
under these conditions, with a wind of 49 miles per hour
and an angle of 1 in 8, the lifting effect ran up to 14&middot;87 lbs.
with a drift of 2&middot;44 lbs., and the condenser delivered 2&middot;87
lbs. of water from dry steam in five minutes. The weight
of metal in this condenser was extremely small, the thickness
being only about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>500</sub> of an inch. This condenser
delivered the weight of the sustainers in water every five
minutes. They should, however, have been twice as heavy.
Cylinder oil was now introduced with the steam in order
to ascertain what effect this would have. After seven
minutes&#8217; steaming, 2&middot;25 lbs. of water were condensed in
five minutes. It will be seen from these experiments that
an atmospheric condenser, if properly constructed, is fairly
efficient. Roughly speaking, it requires 2,400 times as
much air in volume as of water to use as a cooling agent.
With the steam engine condenser only a relatively small
amount of water is admitted, and this is found to be
sufficient; but in an atmospheric condenser working in the
atmosphere, it must be as open as possible, so that no air
which has struck one heated surface can ever come in
contact with another.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="chapname">EXPERIMENTS WITH APPARATUS ATTACHED
TO A ROTATING ARM.</span></h2>

<p>From what information I have at hand, it appears that
Prof. Langley made his first experiments with a small
apparatus, using aeroplanes only a few inches in dimensions
which travelled round a circle perhaps 12 feet in diameter.
With this little apparatus, he was able to show that the
lifting effect of aeroplanes was a great deal more than had
previously been supposed. After having made these first
experiments, he seems to have come to the conclusion that
Newton&#8217;s law was erroneous. Shortly after Langley had
made these experiments on what he called a whirling
table, which, however, was not a very appropriate name, I
made an apparatus myself, but very much larger than that
employed by Prof. Langley. I reckoned the size of my
aeroplanes in feet, where he had reckoned his in inches.
The circumference of the circle around which my aeroplanes
were driven was exactly 200 feet, and shortly after this
Langley constructed another apparatus, the same dimensions
as my own. From an engraving which I have before
me, it appears that he constructed an extremely large
wooden scale beam supported by numerous braces, but free
to be tilted in a vertical direction after the manner of all
other scale beams. As this apparatus was of great weight
and offered enormous resistance to the air, I do not understand
how it was possible to obtain any very correct
readings, especially as it was in the open and subject to
every varying current of air.</p>

<p>In constructing my apparatus, which is shown in the
<a href="#Fig33">photographs</a>, and also in a side elevation (<a href="#Fig32">Fig. 32</a>), I aimed
at making the apparatus very light and strong, avoiding as
far as possible atmospheric resistance. In the drawing, <i>a</i>,
is a thick seamless steel pipe 6 inches diameter; <i>b</i>, is a cast-iron
pedestal firmly bolted to <i>d</i>, and connected to a large
cast-iron spider embedded in hydraulic cement; by this
means great rigidity and stiffness were obtained. <i>n</i>, <i>n</i> was
formed of strong Georgia pine planks 2 inches thick, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a><br /><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
strongly bolted together. The two members of the long
radial arm <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, were made of Honduras mahogany, an
extremely strong wood, and had their edges tapered off as
shown at <i>y</i>, <i>y</i>. The power was transmitted from a small
steam engine provided with a sensitive governor through
the shaft <i>f</i>, <i>f</i>. In the base <i>c</i>, of the casting <i>b</i>, was placed a
pair of tempered steel bevel gears, giving to the vertical
shaft a high velocity. From a pulley on the top of this
shaft, the belt <i>i</i>, was run through the arms <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, as shown in
section <i>y</i>, <i>y</i>. This gave a rapid rotation to the screw shaft
in a very simple manner. The operation of the machine
was as follows:&mdash;the aeroplane <i>g</i>, to be tested was secured
to a sort of weighing apparatus which is shown in detail
(<a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>), and the screw attached to the shaft. Upon
starting the engine, a very rapid rotation was given to the
screw which caused the radial arm to travel at a high
velocity, the whole weight resting on a ball bearing at <i>w</i>.
The radial arms and all of their attachments were balanced
by a cigar-shaped lead weight <i>s</i>, which was secured to a
sliding bar so as to make it easily adjustable. The thrust
of the screw caused the screw shaft to travel longitudinally,
and this was opposed by a spring connected by a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
thin and light wire to the pointer of the index <i>o</i>. As the
apparatus rotated rather slowly on account of its great
diameter, it was quite possible to observe the lift while the
machine was running at its highest speed. The aeroplanes
were mounted after the manner of the tray of a grocer&#8217;s
scales (see <a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>), and the lift of the aeroplane was
determined by what it would lift at <i>r</i>&mdash;that is, while
the machine was running at a given speed, iron or lead
weights were placed in the pail <i>r</i>, until the lift of the
aeroplane was exactly balanced, and then, in order to
ascertain exactly what the lift was, the aeroplane was
placed under what might be called a small crane, and
a cord, running over a pulley, attached. The amount of
weight necessary to lift the plane into the same position
that it occupied while running was taken as its true
lift. In order to facilitate experiments the gauge <i>p</i>,
was provided. This gauge consisted of a large glass tube
and the index <i>p</i>, with a quantity of red water at <i>q</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
centrifugal force of rotation caused the red water to rise
in the tube. This was easily seen, so that if experiments
were being tried, we will say at 50 miles an hour, it
was always possible to turn on steam until the red
liquid mounted to 50. This device was very simple
and effective, and saved a great deal of time. In order to
prevent the twisting of the radial arm, a piece of stiff
oval steel tube 12 feet long was secured between the arms
at <i>j</i>, and on each end of this tube were attached the wires
<i>u</i>, <i>u</i>. This not only effectually supported the end of
the arm, but at the same time prevented twisting and
made everything extremely stiff. Of course, while the
machine was running at a high velocity, centrifugal force
had to be dealt with, and in order to prevent this from
causing friction in the articulated joints of the weighing
apparatus (<a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>), thin steel wires <i>k</i>, <i>k</i> were provided.
As this apparatus was in the open, it was found that
the slightest movement of the air greatly interfered with
its action. On one occasion when a fabric covered aeroplane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
4 feet long by 3 feet wide, was placed in position,
the four corners being held down by the wires <i>v</i>, <i>v</i>, and
the apparatus driven at a high velocity, a sudden gust of
wind snapped two of the wires, broke the aeroplane, and
the flying fragments smashed the screw, and this notwithstanding
that each of the four wires was supposed to be
strong enough to resist at least four times any possible
lifting that the whole aeroplane might be subjected to.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain the force and direction of the
wind, I made an extremely simple and effective apparatus
which is fully shown (see <a href="#Fig38">Fig. 38</a>). Whilst conducting
these experiments it occurred to me, when a large aeroplane
was used, that after it had been travelling for a considerable
time, it would impart to the air in the path of its
travel, a downward motion, and that the lifting effect
would be greatly reduced on this account. In order to
test this, I provided four light brass screws and mounted
them, as shown at <i><a href="#Fig32">x</a></i>, on a hardened polished steel point
much above their centre of gravity, so that they balanced
themselves. On account of the absence of friction, they
were easily rotated, and responded to the least breath of
air that might be moving. One morning when there was
a dead calm, I placed four of these screws equidistant
around the whole circle. Some of them rotated very
slowly in one direction and some in another; some alternated,
but all their motions were extremely slow. However,
upon setting the machine going with a large aeroplane and
a powerful screw, I found after a few turns that the air
was moving downwards around the whole circle at a
velocity of about 2 miles an hour, but as the screw was
a considerable distance below the aeroplane, I estimated
that the actual downward velocity of the air in which the
aeroplane was travelling was about 4 miles an hour.
The result of my experiments are clearly shown in an
unpublished paper which I wrote at the time, and as it is
of considerable historical interest, I have placed it in the
<a href="#Page_130">appendix</a>, notwithstanding that there may be certain
repetitions.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i> is the body of the apparatus, partly of
gunmetal and partly of wood. It is provided with a steel
shaft to which the screw <i>h</i>, is attached, and also with a
cylindrical pulley for taking the belt. The thrust of the
screw pushes the shaft inwards and records the lift at <i>o</i>
(<a href="#Fig32">Fig. 32</a>). The corners of the aeroplane <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, are attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>

placed at <i>e</i>, sufficient to balance the lifting effect, and then
by adding the weight to the upward pull of the aeroplane,
the true lift of the aeroplane is obtained. It is also
possible to attach an aeroplane at <i>e</i>, that is, the machine
was made to test superposed aeroplanes if required. In
these experiments, I naturally assumed that the best
position for a screw was at the rear and in the path of
the greatest resistance, but as some experimenters with
navigable balloons placed the screw in front in order
to pull the apparatus along instead of to push it, I made
experiments to see what the relative difference might be.
In order to do this, I wound a large amount of rope one-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
inch in diameter around the whole apparatus
forward of the screw, converting it into an irregular mass
well calculated to offer atmospheric resistance. Upon
starting the engine, I was rather surprised to see how
little retardation these ropes gave to the apparatus. It
appeared to me that nearly all of the energy consumed in
driving the ropes through the air was recovered by the
screw. I then removed the right-hand screw and replaced
it by a left-hand screw of the same pitch and dimensions
(<a href="#Fig37a">Fig. 37<i>a</i></a>). I then found that the blast of the screw blowing
against the tangle of ropes greatly retarded the travel; in
fact, with the same number of revolutions per minute, the
velocity fell off 60 per cent. I think that these experiments
ought to show that there is but one place for the
screw, and that is at the stern, and in the direct path
of the greatest atmospheric resistance.</p>

<p class="capcenter">Fig. 38.&mdash;Apparatus for indicating the force and velocity of the wind direct without any
timing, counting, or mathematical calculations.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig38">Fig. 38</a> shows an original apparatus which I designed
and made for my own use; with ordinary anemometers it
is necessary to count the number of turns per minute in
order to ascertain the velocity of the wind. I wanted
something that would indicate the velocity and the
direction of the wind without any figures or formul&aelig;.
I therefore made the apparatus shown in the drawing,
in which <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, is a metallic disc 13&middot;54 inches in diameter,
giving it an area of exactly 1 square foot. This is
attached to the horizontal bar <i>b</i>, and the whole mounted
on two bell crank levers as shown. When the wind is
not blowing, the long arms of these two levers assume
a vertical position, and the spiral spring <i>h</i>, is in exact
line with the pivots on which these levers are mounted,
and has no effect except to hold the levers in a vertical
position. As the spring has very little tension in this
position, and as it requires a considerable movement in
order to give it tension, the arms <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, and the bar <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, are
very easily pushed backwards, but as the distance through
which they travel increases, the angle of the lever changes
and the tension of the spring increases at the same time,
so that when the disc is pushed backwards to any considerable
distance, a strong resistance is encountered. Had
I made this apparatus so that the pressure acted directly
on the spiral spring, the spaces on the index indicating
low velocities would have been very near together, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a><br /><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
those indicating high velocities would have been widely
separated, but with this device properly designed, the
spacing on the index became regular and even. The index
being very large enabled one to read it at a considerable
distance, and at the same time, it acted as a tail and kept
the apparatus face to the wind. The spaces of the dial
were not laid off with a pair of dividers, but each particular
division was marked by an actual pull on the bar <i>b</i>,
through the agency of a cord and easily running pulley
and weight. The markings, however, were not correct,
because Haswell&#8217;s formula was employed in which the
pressure of the wind against the normal plane is considerably
greater than with the more recent formula, which
is now known to be correct. Haswell&#8217;s formula was
V&sup2; &times; &middot;005 = P, and the recent formula P = 0&middot;003 &times; V&sup2;, where
P = pressure in lbs. per square foot and V = velocity in
miles per hour. In my experiments, I also employed a very
well made and delicate anemometer by Negretti &amp; Zambra.</p>

<h3>CRYSTAL PALACE EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

<p>Having fully satisfied myself that aeroplanes flying
around a circle 200 feet in circumference had their lifting
effect reduced to no insignificant degree by constantly
engaging air which had already had imparted to it a downward
movement by a previous revolution, I determined to
make some experiments where this trouble could not occur,
but the opportunity did not present itself until after the
large roundabout, erroneously described as &#8220;a captive
flying machine,&#8221; was put up at the Crystal Palace. This
presented a fine opportunity for making experiments at an
extremely high velocity around a very large circle. I will
only refer to a few of these experiments. To a prolongation
of one of the long arms, I attached a thin steel wire
rope about 60 feet above the platform; I then attached to
this wire rope the little device shown (<a href="#Fig39">Fig. 39</a>), in which <i>a</i>,
is an aeroplane, 5 feet long and 1 foot wide, placed at an
inclination of 1 in 20. Great care was used in preparing
this aeroplane to see that it was free from blemish, smooth,
and without any irregularities. Both edges were sharp
and the curvature was about one-eighth of an inch on
the underneath side. It was made relatively thick in the
middle where it was attached to the bar <i>c</i>, and thinner at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the ends. <i>b</i>, shows a lump of lead just heavy enough to
balance the bar <i>c</i>, and the tail; <i>d</i>, was a light but strong
wooden frame, all the edges being thin and sharp, and
covered with a special silk that Mr. Cody had found
to be best for such purposes. The wire rope <i>e</i>, was attached
to the long arm which I referred to. The great length
of the bar <i>c</i>, and the accuracy with which the whole was
made and balanced caused the aeroplane to travel straight
through the air adjusting itself to all the shifting currents.
Upon starting the machine on a very calm day, this
apparatus mounted as high as the point of support, sometimes
going 10 or more feet higher and sometimes 8 or
10 feet lower. However, as a rule, it carried its own
weight at a velocity of 80 miles an hour around a circle
1,000 feet in circumference. Under these conditions, of
course, there could be no downward motion of the air
as all the air affected would be removed long before it
could be struck the second time by the aeroplane. I had
no means of ascertaining exactly how much this plane did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
actually lift, because the air was always moving to some
extent, and it was not an easy matter to ascertain whether
it was above or below the point of support. I am sure,
however, that it was as much as 36 lbs., or rather more
than 7 lbs. to the square foot, and this is just what it
should have lifted, providing that we consider the results
obtained by smaller planes placed in an air blast of
40 miles an hour and at the same angle. When these
experiments were finished, I made a very small apparatus
having only about 25 square feet of lifting surface, and
this carried the weight of a man, in fact several gentlemen
came up from London and went round on it themselves.
I saw, however, that it was a dangerous practice, because
if the wind was blowing at all, the apparatus would mount
very much above the point of support while travelling
against the wind, only to drop much below the point
of support on the other side of the circle where it was
travelling with the wind; in fact, on one occasion the
apparatus shown (<a href="#Fig39">Fig. 39</a>) mounted in a high wind fully
20 feet above the point of support and came down with
such a crash on the other side that it broke the wire rope.
In connection with this, it is interesting to note that when
I erected the first so-called &#8220;captive flying machine&#8221; on
my own grounds at Thurlow Park, I intended that instead
of ordinary boats such as were ultimately employed, each
particular boat should be fitted with an aeroplane, that the
engine should be of 200 H.P., and that the passengers
should actually be running on the air, each boat being
provided with a powerful electric motor in addition to the
motive power that drove the shaft. Had this been carried
out as was originally designed, it would have removed the
apparatus altogether from the category of vulgar merry-go-rounds,
but such was not to be. Unforeseen circumstances
were against me. I had some of these boats fitted up with
aeroplanes and running on my grounds, and two of the
engineers of the London County Council came out to see
the apparatus before it was put up for public use. On
that occasion the wind was blowing a perfect gale of
40 miles an hour, and as the boats travelled at the rate
of 35 miles an hour, they, of course, encountered a wind
of 75 miles an hour when passing against the wind, and
a minus velocity of 5 miles an hour when travelling with
the wind on the other side of the circle. The aeroplanes,
although of considerable size, were small in relation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
weight. I had neglected to put any weight in the boats,
and when three of us were studying the eccentric path
through which the boats were travelling, suddenly one
of them in passing to the windward, raised very much
above the point of support and plunged down with great
force on the other side; in fact, the shock was so great
that it made everything rattle, but nothing was broken.
Nevertheless, the engineers said at once, it would not do to
run the boats with those aeroplanes; it was too dangerous.
This would not, however, have occurred if the boats had
been loaded, or the velocity of the wind had been less. It,
however, demonstrated what a tremendous lift may be
obtained from a well-made aeroplane passing at a high
velocity through the wind at a sharp angle. These
aeroplanes were only about 12 feet long and 5 feet wide,
having, therefore, 60 square feet of surface. They were,
however, strong, well-made, and perfectly smooth, both
top and bottom. I would say right here that I am not
a success as a showman&mdash;previous long years of rubbing
up against honest men have disqualified me altogether for
such a profession. I was extremely anxious to go on with
my experiments. I appreciated fully that I had made
a machine that lifted 2,000 lbs. more than its own weight,
and I knew for a dead certainty if I took the matter up
again, got rid of my boiler and water tank, and used an
internal combustion engine, such as I thought I could
produce, that mechanical flight would soon be a <i>fait
accompli</i>. I had already spent more than &pound;20,000, and
was looking about for some means of making the thing
self-supporting. I believed that the so-called &#8220;captive
flying machine&#8221; would be very popular, and bring in a
lot of money, and it would have done so, if it had been
put up as originally designed. I proposed to use my
share of the profits for experimental work on real flying
machines. That I was not far wrong in believing that
such a machine would be a success, is witnessed by the
fact that just about the same time, an American inventor
thought of the same thing, put up some three or four
machines the first year, and the next year about 50. They
were highly profitable, and there are fully 140 of them
running at the present time in the U.S.A. It is a fact
that nothing in the way of side-shows at exhibitions or
public resorts has ever had the success of this machine in
the U.S.A., and even the little machine at Earl&#8217;s Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
took &pound;325 10s. in one day and &pound;7,500 in a season. However,
this little attempt to make one hand wash the other
cost me no less than &pound;10,400, not to mention more than
a year of very hard work. This sum would have been
amply sufficient to have enabled me to continue my experiments
until success was assured.</p>

<p>For those who really wish to build a flying machine that
will actually fly with very little experimental work, I have
given an outline sketch sufficiently explicit to enable a
skilful draughtsman to make a working drawing in which
<a href="#Fig40">Fig. 40</a> is a front elevation, <a href="#Fig41">Fig. 41</a> a side elevation, and
<a href="#Fig42">Fig. 42</a> a plan. <a href="#Fig41">Fig. 41</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, shows the two forward or

buffers; <i>k</i> and <i>l</i>, wheels attached to a lever pivoted to the
body of the machine; <i>q</i>, a shield for protecting the screw.
It will be observed that the framework is extremely long,
and, consequently, the distance between the aeroplanes is
very great; but it should be borne in mind that the longer
the machine, the less any change of center of lifting effect,
as relates to the center of gravity, will be felt. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a><br /><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
it is much easier to man&#339;uvre a machine of great length
than one which is very short, because it gives one more
time to think and act. If the length was infinitely great
the tendency to pitch would be infinitely small. I have
shown a steering gear consisting of a lever with a handle
<i>n</i>, arranged in such a manner that it moves both the
vertical rudder <i>c</i>, and the horizontal rudder <i>d</i>, so that the
man who steers the machine has nothing to think of except
to point the lever <i>n</i>, <i>p</i>, in the direction that he wishes the
machine to go. This lever is mounted on a universal joint
at <i>h</i>, and is connected with suitable wires to the two
rudders. In order to prevent shock when the machine
alights, it is necessary to provide something that is strong
and, at the same time, yielding, and able to travel through
a considerable distance before the machine comes to a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of rest. In the machines which I have seen on the Continent,
a very elaborate apparatus is employed, which is
not only very heavy, but also offers a considerable resistance
to the forward motion of the machine through the air.
It consists of many tubes, very long levers and heavy spiral
springs, etc. In the device which I am recommending,
all this is dispensed with, and something very much
simpler, cheaper, and lighter is substituted. Moreover,
with my proposed apparatus a certain amount of lifting
effect is produced. The levers <i>k</i>, <i>k</i>, to which the wheels are
attached, should be of thin wood, light and strong, and
say about a foot wide, strongly pivoted to the frame and
held in position by an atmospheric buffer made of strong
and thin steel tubing, shown in section (<a href="#Fig51">Fig. 51</a>). These
pneumatic cylinders may be pumped up to any degree, so
as to support the weight of the machine, and then, as it
comes down, the compression and escape of air arrest its
motion. The condenser <i>g</i>, is placed in such a position that
it will act even while the machine is on the ground and the
propellers working. In Continental machines, very small
screw propellers are used. These screws have probably
been made small because the experimenters have found
that they encounter a good deal of friction in the atmosphere,
but this is caused by imperfect shape and the rib of
steel at the back of the blades. In order to use a small
screw, experimenters have been forced to use a very quick-running
engine which makes it necessary to have the
cylinders very short, so, in order to get the necessary
power, they are obliged to use no less than eight cylinders.
However, by increasing the diameter of the screw and
making it of such a form that very little or no atmospheric
skin friction is encountered, a much better and cheaper
engine of a totally different type may be employed. There
is no reason why more than four cylinders should be used,
but the stroke of the piston and diameter of the cylinder
should be increased. Doubtless Continental experimenters
have an idea that, as the engine cannot be provided with a
flywheel, it must have a very large number of cylinders in
order to give a steady pull completely around the circle, and
thus avoid so-called &#8220;dead centers&#8221;; but, when we consider
the enormously high velocity of the periphery of the screw,
and also take into consideration that the momentum is in
proportion to the square of the velocity, it is quite obvious
that there can be no slowing up between strokes even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
only one cylinder should be employed working on the
four-cycle principle, in which work is only done one stroke
in four. Then, again, I find that the weight of these
Continental engines can be greatly reduced, providing that
they are made with the same degree of refinement that
I employed in building my steam engines.</p>

<p>Recently there has been a great deal of discussion in
<i>Engineering</i> and other journals regarding the comparative
merits of the aeroplane system and the h&eacute;licopt&egrave;re.
Some condemn both systems and pin their faith to flapping
wings. It has been contended that the screw propeller
is extremely wasteful in energy, and that in all Nature
neither fish nor bird propels itself by means of a screw.
As we do not find a screw in Nature, why then should we
employ it in a machine for performing artificial flight?</p>

<p>Why not stick to Nature? In reply to this, I would
say that even Nature has her limits, beyond which she
cannot go. When a boy was told that everything was
possible with God, he asked; &#8220;Could God make a two-year
old calf in five minutes?&#8221; He was told that God certainly
could. &#8220;But,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;would the calf be two years
old?&#8221; It appears to me that there is nothing in Nature
which is more efficient, or gets a better grip on the water
than a well-made screw propeller, and no doubt there
would have been fish with screw propellers, providing that
Dame Nature could have made an animal in two pieces. It
is very evident that no living creature could be made in two
pieces, and two pieces are necessary if one part is
stationary and the other revolves; however, the tails and
fins very often approximate to the action of the propeller
blades; they turn first to the right and then to the left,
producing a sculling effect which is practically the same.
This argument might also be used against locomotives. In
all Nature, we do not find an animal travelling on wheels,
but it is quite possible that a locomotive might be made
that would walk on legs at the rate of two or three miles
an hour. But locomotives with wheels are able to travel
at least three times as fast as the fleetest animal with legs,
and to continue doing so for many hours at a time, even
when attached to a very heavy load. In order to build a
flying machine with flapping wings, to exactly imitate
birds, a very complicated system of levers, cams, cranks,
etc., would have to be employed, and these of themselves
would weigh more than the wings would be able to lift.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
However, it is quite possible to approach very closely to
the motion of a bird&#8217;s wings with no reciprocating or

<p class="capcenter">Fig. 44.&mdash;Shows the position of the blades of a h&eacute;licopt&egrave;re as they pass
around a circle, when the angle of the shaft and the angle of the
blades are the same.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#Fig43">Fig. 43</a>, I have shown a plan of a h&eacute;licopt&egrave;re machine
in which two screws are employed rotating in opposite
directions, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, being the port screw; <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, the starboard
screw; and <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, the platform for the machinery and
operator. The screws should be 20 feet in diameter and
made of wood. Suppose now that the pitch of these
screws is such that the extremities of the blades have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
an angle of 5&deg;; if now we tilt the shaft forward in the
direction of flight to the extent of 5&deg;, we shall completely
wipe out the angle of inclination of the blades when at <i>b</i>
(<a href="#Fig44">Fig. 44</a>), whereas it will be observed that the pitch as
regards the horizontal will be increased to 10&deg; at <i>a</i>, on the
outer side, and remain unchanged at <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>. If the
peripheral velocity of the blades is, say, four times the
velocity at which the machine is expected to travel,
the blades will get a good grip on the air at <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, but when
they travel forward and encounter air which is travelling
at a high velocity in the opposite direction, they assume
the position shown at <i>b</i>. If the pitch of the screw blades
was a little more than the angle of the shaft, the blades at
<i>b</i> would also produce a lifting effect, and as the velocity
with which they pass through the air is extremely high, a
very strong lifting effect would be produced even if the
angle was not more than 1 in 40. By tracing the path and
noting the position of the ends of the blades as they pass
completely around the circle as shown (<a href="#Fig44">Fig. 44</a>), it will be
observed that they very closely resemble the motion of a
bird&#8217;s wing. I have no doubt that a properly made
machine on this plan would be highly satisfactory, but one
should not lose sight of the fact that even with a machine
of this type, well designed and sufficiently light to sustain
itself in the air while flying, it would still be necessary for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
it to move along rapidly when starting in order to get the
necessary grip on the air. Upon starting the engine, in a
machine of this kind, a very strong downward draught of
air would be produced, and the whole power of the engines
would be used in maintaining this downward blast, but if
the machine should at the same time be given a rapid
forward motion sufficiently great to bring the blades into
contact with new air, the inertia of which had not been
disturbed, and which was not moving downwards, the
lifting effect would be increased sufficiently to lift the
machine off the ground. It would, therefore, work very
much like an aeroplane machine. It would also be possible
to provide a third screw of less dimensions and running at
a less velocity, to push the machine forward, so as not to
render it necessary to give such a decided tilt to the shafts.</p>

<p>As before stated, great care should be taken in designing
and making the framework of flying machines, and no
stone should be left unturned in order to arrive at the
greatest degree of lightness without diminishing the
strength too much; then, again, elasticity should be considered.
If we use a thin tube all the material is at the
surface, far from the neutral centre, and great stiffness is
obtained, but such a tube will not stand so much deflection
as a piece of wood; then, again, wood is cheaper than steel,
and in case of an accident, repairs are very quickly and
easily made. Wood, however, cannot be obtained in long
lengths absolutely free from blemishes. It therefore
becomes necessary to find some way of making these long
members of flying machines of such wood as may be found
suitable in the following table.</p>

<p>The relative value of different kinds of wood is shown in
this table, and it will be observed that some are much more
suitable for the purpose than others. The true value of a
wood to be used in flying machines is only ascertained
by considering its strength in comparison with its own
weight&mdash;that is, the wood which is strongest in proportion
to its weight is the best. It will be seen that Honduras
mahogany stands at the head of the list, but American
white pine is very good for certain purposes, as it is light,
strong, easily obtained, and takes the glue very well
indeed. In <a href="#Fig45">Fig. 45</a>, I have shown a good system of
producing the long members necessary in flying machines.
I will admit that it costs something to fit up and produce
the kind of joints which I have shown, but when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85<br />86]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
members are once made, they are exceedingly strong and
stiff. <a href="#Fig46">Fig. 46</a> shows sections of the struts, and these may
be made of either straight-grained Honduras mahogany or
of lance wood; either answers the purpose very well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
because being very strong and straight-grained,
permits the struts to be made
of such a shape and size as to offer
very little resistance in cutting their
way through the air. The framework
of the aeroplane unless carefully designed
will offer great resistance to
being driven through the air. Suppose
that the bottom member of the truss
(<a href="#Fig47">Fig. 47</a>) is straight, and the top one
curved in the direction shown; no
matter how taut the cloth may be
drawn, the pressure of the air will
cause it to bag upwards between the
different trusses, so as to present very
nearly the correct curve which is
necessary to produce the maximum
lifting effect, and without offering too
much resistance to the air; however,
one must not forget for a single moment
that the air flows over both sides of
the aeroplane. When the aeroplane is
made very thick in the middle and
sharp at the edges (<a href="#Fig48">Fig. 48</a>), with the
bottom side dead level, it produces a
decided lifting effect no matter which
way it is being propelled through the
air. This is not because the bottom
side produces any lifting effect of itself,
but because the air running over the
top follows the surface. The aeroplane
encounters air which is not moving at
all. The air is first moved upwards
slightly, but it also has to run down
the incline to the rear edge of the
aeroplane, so that, when it is discharged,
it has a decided downward trend;
therefore, the air passing over the top
side instead of under the bottom side,
produces the lifting effect, showing
that the top side of an aeroplane as
well as the lower side should be considered.
The top side should, therefore,
be free from all obstructions.</p>

<p>The top of the aeroplane as well as the bottom should be
covered with some light material, if the very best results
are to be obtained. In another chapter I have shown a
form of fabric-covered aeroplane, made by myself, that was
not distorted in the least by the air pressure, and produced
just as good effects as it would have done if it had been
carefully carved out of a piece of wood. On more than one
occasion Lord Kelvin came to my place; he said that my
workshop was a perfect museum of invention. At the
Oxford Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement
of Science, Lord Salisbury in the chair, I was much
gratified when Lord Kelvin said that he had examined my
work, and found that it was beautifully designed and
splendidly executed. He complimented me very highly
indeed. While at my place, he said that the most ingenious
thing that he had seen was the way I had prevented
my aeroplanes from being distorted by the air. He spoke
of this several times with great admiration, and, I think, if
the fabric-covered aeroplane is to be used at all, that my
particular system will be found altogether the best.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Regarding the motors now being employed, I think
that there is still room for a great deal of improvement
in the direction of greater lightness, higher efficiency
and reliability. At the present time, flying machine
motors have such small cylinders, the rotation is so rapid,
and the cooling appliances so imperfect, that the engine
soon becomes intensely heated, and then its efficiency
is said to fall off about 40 or 50 per cent., some say even
60 per cent. This is probably on account of the high
temperature of the cylinder, piston, and air inlet. The
heat expands the air as it enters, so that the actual weight
of air in the cylinder is greatly reduced, and the engine
power reduced in a corresponding degree. There is no
trouble about cooling the motor, and a condenser of high
efficiency may be made that will cool the water perfectly,
and, at the same time, lift a good deal more than its
own weight. All the conditions are favourable for using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89<br />90]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
a very effective atmospheric condenser (see <a href="#Fig30">Figs. 30</a>
and <a href="#Fig31">31</a>).</p>

<p>Water may be considered as 2400 times as efficient as
air, volume for volume, in condensing steam. When a
condenser is made for the purpose of using water as a
cooling agent, a large number of small tubes may be closely
grouped together in a box, and the water pumped in at one
end of the box and discharged at the other end through
relatively small openings; but when air is employed, the
tubes or condensing surfaces must be widely distributed, so
that a very large amount of air is encountered, and air
which has struck one tube and become heated must never
touch a second tube (see <a href="#Fig30">Figs. 30</a> and <a href="#Fig31">31</a>, also <a href="#Page_130">Appendix</a>).</p>

is at a state of rest on the ground, the piston-rod <i>d</i>, is run
out to its full extent, and supports the weight of the
machine&mdash;the pressure being about 150 lbs. to the square
inch. When, however, the machine comes violently down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to the earth, the piston is pushed
inward, compressing the air, and by
the time it has travelled, say, one-half
the stroke, the air pressure will
have mounted to 300 lbs. to the
square inch. At this point, the
rubber bulb <i>c</i>, ought to burst and
allow the compressed air to escape
under a high pressure. Air escaping
through a relatively small hole absorbs
the momentum of the descent
and brings the machine to a state
of rest without a destructive shock.
It is, of course, necessary for the
navigator to select a broad and level
field for descent, and then to approach
it from the leeward and slow
up his machine as near the ground
as possible, tilting the forward end
upwards in order to arrest its forward
motion, and touching the
ground while still moving against
the wind at a fairly high velocity.
If all these points are studied, and
well carried out, very little danger
will result; then, again, the aeroplanes
<i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, and the forward rudder
<i>d</i> (<a href="#Fig41">Fig. 41</a>), should be so arranged
that, in case of an accident, their
outward sides may be instantly
turned upwards, in such a manner
as to prevent the machine from
plunging, and keep it on an even
keel while the engines are not
running.</p>

<h3>STEERING BY MEANS OF A GYROSCOPE.</h3>

<p>A ship at sea has only to be steered in a horizontal
direction; the water in which it is floated assures its
stability in a vertical direction; but when a flying machine
is once launched in the air, it has to be steered in two
directions&mdash;that is, the vertical and the horizontal. Moreover,
it is constantly encountering air currents that are
moving with a much higher velocity than any water
currents that have ever to be encountered. It is, therefore,
evident that, as far as vertical steering is concerned, it
should be automatic. Some have suggested shifting
weights, flowing mercury, and swinging pendulums; but
none of these is of the least value, on account of the
swaying action which always has to be encountered. A
pendulum could not be depended upon for working
machinery on board a ship, and the same laws apply to
an airship. We have but one means at our disposal, and
that is the gyroscope. When a gyroscope is spun at a very
high velocity on a vertical axis, with the point of support
very much above the center of gyration, it has a tendency
to maintain a vertical axis; a horizontal or swinging motion
of its support will not cause it to swing like a pendulum.
It therefore becomes possible by its use to maintain an airship
on an even keel. In a steam steering apparatus, such
as is used on shipboard, it is not sufficient to apply steam-power
to move the rudders, unless some means are provided
whereby the movement of the rudder closes off the
steam, otherwise the rudder might continue to travel after
the effect had been produced, and ultimately be broken;
and so it is with steering a flying machine in a vertical
direction. Whenever the fore and aft rudders respond to
the action of the gyroscope and are set in motion, they
must at once commence to shut off the power that works
them, otherwise they would continue to travel. In the
photograph (<a href="#Fig52">Fig. 52</a>) I have shown an apparatus which I
constructed at Baldwyn&#8217;s Park. It will be seen that the
gyroscope is enclosed in a metal case; a tangent screw, just
above the case, rotates a pointer around a small disc, which
admits of the speed of the gyroscope being observed.
Steam is admitted through a universal joint, descends
through the shaft and escapes through a series of small
openings placed at a tangent, so as to give rotation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
wheel after the manner of a Barker&#8217;s mill. The casing
about the rotating wheel is extremely light as relates to the
wheel, so that, when the gyroscope is once spun on a
vertical axis, the rest of the apparatus may be tilted in any
direction, while the gyroscope and its attachments maintain
a vertical axis. The gyroscope and its attachments are
suspended from a long steel tube, which in reality is a
steam cylinder. The sleeve which supports the gyroscope
moves freely in a longitudinal direction, and the whole is
held in position by a triple-threaded screw on the small
tube above the cylinder. The steam is admitted through
a piston value operated by a species of link motion, as
shown. The piston-rod extends to each end of the cylinder,
and regulates the rudders by pulling a small wire rope, the
travel of the piston being about 8 feet. At the end of the
cylinder (not shown) the piston-rod is provided with an
arm and a nut which engages the small top tube&mdash;this tube
being provided with a long spiral&mdash;so that, as the piston
moves, the top tube is rotated, and thereby slides the
gyroscope&#8217;s support, and changes its position as relates to
the piston valve. It will, therefore, be seen that the action
is the same as with the common steam steering gear used
on shipboard. A little adjusting screw at the right hand of
the print is shown. The upward projecting arm of the bell
crank lever is for the purpose of attaching the wooden
handle, making it possible to move the connecting-rod
instantly into a position where the steam piston will move
the rudders into the position shown (<a href="#Fig56">Fig. 56</a>).</p>

<p>I copy the following from a description which I wrote
of this apparatus at the time<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gyroscope Apparatus for Automatically Steering
Machine in a Vertical Direction.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;This apparatus consists of a long steam cylinder which
is provided with a piston, the piston-rod extending beyond
the cylinder at each end; the ropes working the fore and
aft rudders are attached to the ends of this piston-rod, and
steam is supplied through an equilibrium valve. The
gyroscope is contained in a gunmetal case, and is driven by
a jet of steam entering through the trunnions. When the
gyroscope is spinning at a high velocity, the casing holding
it becomes very rigid and is not easily moved from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
vertical position. If the machine rears or pitches, the
cylinder and valve are moved with the machine while
the gyroscope remains in a vertical position. This causes
the steam valve to be moved so as to admit steam into the
cylinder and move the piston in the proper direction to
instantly bring the machine back into its normal position.
As the fore and aft rudders are moved, the long tubular
shaft immediately over the steam cylinder is rotated in such
a manner as to move the whole gyroscope in the proper
direction to close off the steam. The apparatus may be
made to regulate at any angle by adjusting the screw
which regulates the position of the tubular shaft. The link
that suspends the end of the steam valve connecting-rod is
supported by a bell crank lever, and while the machine is
moving ahead, the lever occupies the position shown in the
photograph (<a href="#Fig52">Fig. 52</a>); but if the machinery and engine
stop, the bell crank lever may be moved so as to throw the
connecting-rod below the centre, when the steam will move
the piston in the proper direction to throw both the rudders
into the falling position, as shown in <a href="#Fig56">Fig. 56</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="chapname">THE SHAPE AND EFFICIENCY OF AEROPLANES.</span></h2>

<p>In Prof. Langley&#8217;s lifetime, we had many discussions
regarding the width and shape of aeroplanes. The Professor
had made many experiments with very small and narrow
planes, and was extremely anxious to obtain some data
regarding the effect that would be produced by making the
planes of greater width. He admitted that by putting
some two or three aeroplanes tandem, and all at the same
angle, the front aeroplane <i>a</i> (<a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a>), would lift a great
deal more than <i>b</i>, and that <i>c</i>, would lift still less. He
suggested the arrangement shown at <i>a&#8242;</i>, <i>b&#8242;</i>, <i>c&#8242;</i>, in which <i>b&#8242;</i> is
set at such an angle as to give as much additional acceleration
to the air as it had received in the first instance by
passing under <i>a&#8242;</i>, and that <i>c&#8242;</i>, should also increase the
acceleration to the same extent. With this arrangement,
the lifting effect of the three aeroplanes ought to be
the same, but I did not agree with this theory. It seemed
to me that it would only be true if it dealt with the
volume of air represented between <i>j</i>, and <i>k</i>, and that he did
not take into consideration the mass of air between <i>k</i>, and <i>l</i>,
that had to be dealt with, and which would certainly have
some effect in buoying up the stream of air, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>. Prof.
Langley admitted the truth of this, and said that nothing
but experiment would demonstrate what the real facts
were. But it was a matter which I had to deal with. I
did not like the arrangement <i>a&#8242;</i>, <i>b&#8242;</i>, <i>c&#8242;</i>, as the angle was so
sharp, especially at <i>c&#8242;</i>, that a very large screw thrust would
be necessary. I therefore made a compromise on this
system which is shown at <i>a&#8242;&#8242;</i>, <i>b&#8242;&#8242;</i>, <i>c&#8242;&#8242;</i>. In this case <i>a&#8242;&#8242;</i>, has an
inclination of 1 in 10, <i>b&#8242;&#8242;</i> an inclination of 1 in 6, and
<i>c&#8242;&#8242;</i> an inclination of 1 in 5. It will be seen that this form,
which is shown as one aeroplane at <i>a&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;</i>, <i>b&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;</i>, <i>c&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;</i>, is a very
good shape. It is laid out by first drawing the line <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>,
dropping the perpendicular equal to one-tenth of the
distance between <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, and then drawing a straight line
from <i>c</i>, through <i>e</i>, to <i>f</i>, where another perpendicular is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
dropped, and half the distance between <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> laid
off, and another straight line drawn from <i>e</i>, through <i>g</i>, to <i>h</i>,
and the perpendicular <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, laid off the same as <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>. We
then have four points, and by drawing a curve through
these, we obtain the shape of the aeroplane shown above,
which is an exceedingly good one. This shape, however,
is only suitable for velocities, up to 40 miles per hour;
at higher velocities, the curvature would be correspondingly
reduced.</p>

<h3>THE ACTION OF AEROPLANES AND THE POWER
REQUIRED EXPRESSED IN THE SIMPLEST
TERMS.</h3>

<p>In designing aeroplanes for flying machines, we should not
lose sight of the fact that area alone is not sufficient. Our
planes must have a certain length of entering edge&mdash;that is,
the length of the front edge must bear a certain relation to
the load lifted. An aeroplane 10 feet square will not lift
half as much for the energy consumed as one 2 feet wide
and 50 feet long; therefore, we must have our planes
as long as possible from port to starboard. At all speeds of
40 miles per hour or less, there should be at least 1 foot of
entering edge for every 4 lbs. carried. However, at higher
speeds, the length may be reduced as the square of
the speed increases. An aeroplane 1 foot square will not
lift one-tenth as much as one that is 1 foot wide and 10 feet
long. This is because the air slips off at the ends, but this
can be prevented by a thin flange, or <i>&agrave; la</i> Hargrave&#8217;s kites.
An aeroplane 2 feet wide and 100 feet long placed at
an angle of 1 in 10, and driven edgewise through the air at a
velocity of 40 miles per hour, will lift 2&middot;5 lbs. per square
foot. But as we find a plane 100 feet in length too long to
deal with, we may cut it into two or more pieces and place
them one above the other&mdash;superposed. This enables us to
reduce the width of our machine without reducing its
lifting effect; we still have 100 feet of entering edge, we
still have 200 feet of lifting surface, and we know that each
foot will lift 2&middot;5 lbs. at the speed we propose to travel.
200 &times; 2&middot;5 = 500; therefore our total lifting effect is 500
lbs., and the screw thrust required to push our aeroplane
through the air is one-tenth of this, because the angle above
the horizontal is 1 in 10. We, therefore, divide what Prof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Langley has so aptly called the &#8220;lift&#8221; by 10;
<span class="division"><span class="num">500</span><span class="denom">10</span></span> = 50.
It will be understood that the vertical component is the
lift, and the horizontal component the drift, the expression
&#8220;drift&#8221; also being a term first applied by Prof. Langley.
Our proposed speed is 40 miles per hour, or 3,520 feet in a
minute of time. If we multiply the drift in pounds by the
number of feet travelled in a minute of time, and divide the
product thus obtained by 33,000, we ascertain the H.P.
required&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="divisionlg"><span class="num">50 &times; 3,520</span><span class="denom">33,000</span></span> = 5&middot;33.</p>

<p>It therefore takes 5&middot;33 H.P. to carry a load of 500 lbs. at a
rate of 40 miles per hour, allowing nothing for screw slip or
atmospheric resistance due to framework and wires. But
we find we must lift more than 500 lbs., and as we do not
wish to make our aeroplanes any longer, we add to their
width in a fore and aft direction&mdash;that is, we place another
similar aeroplane, also 2 feet wide, just aft of our first
aeroplane. This will, of course, have to engage the air
discharged from the first, and which is already moving
downwards. It is, therefore, only too evident that if we
place it at the same angle as our first one&mdash;viz., 1 in 10&mdash;it
will not lift as much as the first aeroplane, and we find that
if we wish to obtain a fairly good lifting effect, it must be
placed at an angle of 1 in 6. Under these conditions, the
screw thrust for this plane will be <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>6</sub>th part of the lift, or
8&middot;88 H.P. against 5&middot;33 H.P. with our first aeroplane. In
order to avoid confusion, we will call our first plane <i>a&#8242;&#8242;</i>, our
second plane <i>b&#8242;&#8242;</i>, and the third <i>c&#8242;&#8242;</i>, the same as in <a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a>.
Still we are not satisfied, we want more lift, we therefore
add still another aeroplane as shown (<i>c&#8242;&#8242;</i>, <a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a>). This
one has to take the air which has already been set in
motion by the two preceding planes <i>a&#8242;&#8242;</i> and <i>b&#8242;&#8242;</i>, so in order
to get a fair lifting effect, we have to place our third plane
at the high angle of 1 in 5. At this angle, our thrust has
to be <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub>th of the lifting effect, and the H.P. required is twice
as much per pound carried as with the plane <i>a&#8242;&#8242;</i>, where the
angle was 1 in 10; therefore, it will take 10&middot;66 H.P. to
carry 500 lbs. As there is no reason why we should have
three aeroplanes placed tandem where one would answer
the purpose much better, we convert the whole of them
into one, as shown (<i>a&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;</i>, <i>b&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;</i>, <i>c&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;</i>, <a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a>), and by making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the top side smooth and uniform, we get the advantage of
the lifting effect due to the air above the aeroplane as well
as below it. The average H.P. is therefore 5&middot;33 + 8&middot;88 +
10&middot;66 &divide; 3 = 8&middot;29 H.P. for each plane, or 25 H.P. for the
whole, which is at the rate of 60 lbs. to the H.P., all of
which is used to overcome the resistance due to the weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and the inclination of the aeroplanes, and which is about
half the total power required. We should allow as much
more for loss in screw slip and atmospheric resistance due
to the motor, the framework, and the wires of the machine.
If, however, the screw is placed in the path of the greatest
resistance, it will recover a portion of the energy imparted
to the air. We shall, however, require a 50 H.P. motor,
and thus have 30 lbs. to the H.P.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it will be seen that at a speed of
40 miles an hour, the weight per H.P. is not very great. If we
wish to make a machine more efficient, we must resort to a
multitude of very narrow superposed planes, or sustainers, as
Mr. Philipps calls them, or we must increase the speed. If an
aeroplane will lift 2&middot;5 lbs. per square foot placed at an angle
of 1 in 10, and driven at a velocity of 40 miles an hour, the
same aeroplane will lift 1&middot;25 lbs. if placed at an angle of
1 in 20, and as the lifting effect varies as the square of the
velocity, the same plane will lift as much more at 60 miles
per hour, as 60&sup2; is greater than 40&sup2;&mdash;that is, 2&middot;81 lbs. per
square foot instead of 1&middot;25 lbs. At this high speed, providing
that the width of the plane is not more than 3 feet,
it need be only slightly curved and have a mean angle of
1 in 20.</p>

<p>An aeroplane 100 feet long and 3 feet wide would have
300 square feet of lifting surface, each of which would lift
2&middot;81 lbs., making the total lifting effect 843 lbs. 843 &divide; 20 =
42&middot;15, which is the screw thrust that would be necessary to
propel such a plane through the air at a velocity of 60 miles
per hour. 60 miles per hour is 5,280 feet in a minute,
therefore the H.P. required is 42&middot;15 &times; 5,280 &divide; 33,000 = 6&middot;7
H.P. Dividing the total lifting effect 843 by 6&middot;7, we
have 843 &divide; 6&middot;7 = 125&middot;8, the lift per H.P. If we allow one-half
for loss in friction, screw slip, etc., we shall be carrying
a load of 843 lbs. with 13&middot;4 H.P. It will, therefore, be seen
that a velocity of 60 miles an hour is much more economical
in power than the comparatively low velocity of 40 miles
an hour; moreover, it permits of a considerable reduction in
the size and weight of the machine, and this diminishes the
atmospheric resistance.</p>

the air appears to be attracted upwards before the aeroplane reaches

the air over the top of the aeroplane is thrown off at a tangent, producing
a strong eddying effect at the top and rear. Just why the air
rises up before the aeroplane reaches it is not plain, and as nothing
could be further from the facts, mathematical formulas founded on
such a mistaken hypothesis can be of but little value to the serious

<h3>SOME RECENT MACHINES.</h3>

<p>Professor S. P. Langley, of the Smithsonian Institute,
Washington, D.C., made a small flying model in 1896.
This, however, only weighed a few pounds; but as it did
actually fly and balance itself in the air, the experiment
was of great importance, as it demonstrated that it was
possible to make a machine with aeroplanes so adjusted
as to steer itself automatically in a horizontal direction. In
order to arrive at this result, an innumerable number of
trials were made, and it was only after months of careful
and patient work that the Professor and his assistants
succeeded in making the model fly in a horizontal direction
without rearing up in front, and then pitching backwards,
or plunging while moving forward.</p>

<p>The Wright Brothers of Dayton, Ohio, U.S.A., often
referred to as &#8220;the mysterious Wrights,&#8221; commenced
experimental work many years ago. The first few years
were devoted to making gliding machines, and it appears
that they attained about the same degree of success as many
others who were experimenting on the same lines at the
same time; but they were not satisfied with mere gliding
machines, and so turned their attention in the direction of
motors. After some years of experimental work, they
applied their motor to one of their large gliding machines,
and it is said that with this first machine they actually
succeeded in flying short distances. Later on, however,
with a more perfect machine, they claim to have made
many flights, amongst which I will mention three: 12 miles
in 20 minutes, on September 29th, 1905; 20&middot;75 miles in 33
minutes, on October 4th; and 24&middot;2 miles in 38 minutes, on
October 5th of the same year. As there seems to be much
doubt regarding these alleged flights, we cannot refer to
them as facts until the Wright Brothers condescend to show
their machine and make a flight in the presence of others;
nevertheless, I think we are justified in assuming that they
have met with a certain degree of success which may or
may not be equal to the achievements of Messrs Farman and
De la Grange. It is interesting to note in this connection
that all flying machines that have met with any success
have been made on the same lines; all have superposed
aeroplanes, all have fore and aft horizontal rudders, and all
are propelled with screws; and in this respect they do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
differ from the large machine that I made at Baldwyn&#8217;s
Park many years ago. I have seen both the Farman and
the De la Grange machines; they seem to be about the same
in size and design, and what is true of one is equally true
of the other; I will, therefore, only describe the one that
seems to have done the best&mdash;the De la Grange. The general
design of this machine is clearly shown in the illustrations
(<a href="#Fig68">Figs. 68</a> and <a href="#Fig69">69</a>). The dimensions are as follows: The two
main aeroplanes are 32&middot;8 feet long and 4&middot;9 feet wide; the
tail or after rudder is made in the form of a Hargrave&#8217;s box
kite, the top and bottom sides of the box being curved and
covered with balloon fabric, thus forming aeroplanes. This
box is 9&middot;84 feet long from port to starboard, and 6&middot;56 feet
wide in a fore and aft direction. The diameter of the screw
is 7&middot;2 feet and it has a mean pitch of 5&middot;7 feet. The screw
blades are two in number and are extremely small, being
only 6&middot;3 inches wide at the outer end and 3&middot;15 inches at
the inner end, their length being 2&middot;1 feet. The space
between the fore and aft aeroplanes is 4&middot;9 feet. The total
weight is about 1,000 lbs. with one man on board. The
speed of this machine through the air is not known with
any degree of certainty; it is, however, estimated to be
32 to 40 miles per hour. When the screw is making
1,100 revolutions per minute, the motor is said to
develop 50 H.P.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In the following calculations, I have assumed that the
machine has the higher speed&mdash;40 miles per hour. I have
been quite unable to obtain any reliable data regarding the
angle at which the aeroplanes are set, but it would appear
that the angle is about 1 in 10. The total area of the two
main aeroplanes is 321&middot;4 square feet. A certain portion of
the lower main aeroplane is cut away, but this is compensated
for by the forward horizontal rudder placed in the
gap thus formed. The two rear aeroplanes forming the tail
of the machine have an area of 128&middot;57 square feet. The
area of all the aeroplanes is, therefore, 450 square feet. As
the weight of the machine is 1,000 lbs., the lift per square
foot is 2&middot;2 lbs. Assuming that the angle of the aeroplanes
is 1 in 10, the screw thrust would be 100 lbs., providing,
however, that the aeroplanes were perfect and no friction
of any kind was encountered. Forty miles per hour is
at the rate of 3,520 feet in a minute of time, therefore,
<span class="division"><span class="num">3,520 &times; 100</span><span class="denom">33,000</span></span> = 10&middot;66 H.P. If we allow another 10 H.P. for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
atmospheric resistance due to the motor, the man, and the
framework of the machine, it would require 20&middot;66 H.P. to
propel the machine through the air at the rate of 40 miles
per hour. If the motor actually develops 50 H.P., 29 H.P.
will be consumed in screw slip and overcoming the resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
due to the imperfect shape of the screw. The
blades of the De la Grange screw propeller are extremely
small, and the waste of energy is, therefore, correspondingly
great&mdash;their projected area being only 1&middot;6 square feet for
both blades. Allowing 200 lbs. for screw thrust, we have
the following: <span class="division"><span class="num">200</span><span class="denom">1&middot;60</span></span> = 125 lbs. pressure per square foot on
the blades. If we multiply the pitch of the screw in feet
by the number of revolutions per minute, we find that if it
were travelling in a solid nut it would advance over 70
miles an hour. By the Eiffel tower formula P = 0&middot;003 V&sup2;,
a wind blowing at a velocity of 70 miles per hour produces
a pressure of 14&middot;7 lbs. per square foot on a normal plane;
therefore, assuming that the projected area of the screw
blades is 1&middot;6, we have 1&middot;6 &times; 14&middot;7 = 23&middot;52 lbs., which is only
one-fifth part of what the pressure really is when the
screws are making 1,100 turns a minute. It is interesting
to note that the ends of the screw blades travel at a velocity
of 414 feet per second, which is about one-half the velocity
of a cannon ball fired from an old-fashioned smooth bore.</p>

</div>

<p>A flying machine has, of course, to be steered in two
directions at the same time&mdash;the vertical and the horizontal.
In the Farman and De la Grange machines, the horizontal
steering is effected by a small windlass provided with a
hand wheel, the same as on a steam launch, and the vertical
steering is effected by a longitudinal motion of the shaft of
the same windlass. As the length of the machine is not
very great, it requires very close attention on the part of
the man at the helm to keep it on an even keel; if one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
not able to think and act quickly, disaster is certain. On
one occasion, the man at the wheel pushed the shaft of the
windlass forward when he should have pulled it back, and
the result was a plunge and serious damage to the machine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
happily no one was injured, though some of the bystanders
were said to have had very narrow escapes. The remedy
for this is to make all hand-steered machines of great
length, which gives more time to think and act; or, still
better, to make them automatic by the use of a gyroscope.</p>

stationary air and leaves it with a downward trend. With a thick
curved aeroplane, as shown, the air follows both the top and the

of these two streams of air. It will be seen that the air takes the
same direction that it would take if the plane were flat, and raised
from <i>a</i> to <i>c</i>, which would be substantially the same as shown at <i>f</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>g</i>.
It has, however, been found by actual experiment that the curved

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="chapname">BALLOONS.</span></h2>

<p>As far as the actual navigation of the air is concerned,
balloonists have had everything to themselves until quite
recently, but we find that at the present moment, experimenters
are dividing their attention about equally between
balloons or machines lighter than the air, and true flying
machines or machines heavier than the air. In all Nature,
we do not find any bird or insect that does not fly by
dynamic energy alone, and I do not believe that the time
is far distant when those now advocating machines lighter
than the air, will join the party advocating machines heavier
than the air, and, eventually, balloons will be abandoned
altogether. No matter from what standpoint we examine
the subject, the balloon is unsuitable for the service, and it is
not susceptible of much improvement. On the other hand,
the flying machine is susceptible of a good deal of improvement;
there is plenty of scope for the employment of a
great deal of skill, both mechanical and scientific, for a good
many years to come.</p>

<p>I do not know that I can express myself better now
than I did when I wrote an article for the Engineering
Supplement of the <i>Times</i>, from which I quote the
following<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The result of recent experiments must have convinced
every thinking man that the day of the balloon is past. A
balloon, from the very nature of things, must be extremely
bulky and fragile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has always appeared to the writer that it would be
absolutely impossible to make a dirigible balloon that would
be of any use, even in a comparatively light wind. Experiments
have shown that only a few hundred feet above the
surface of the earth, the air is nearly always moving at a
velocity of at least 15 miles an hour, and more than two-thirds
of the time at a velocity considerably greater than
this. In order to give a balloon sufficient lifting power to
carry two men and a powerful engine, it is necessary that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
it should be of enormous bulk. Considered as a whole,
including men and engine, it must have a mean density
less than the surrounding air, otherwise it will not rise.
Therefore, not only is a very large surface exposed to the
wind, but the whole thing is so extremely light and fragile
as to be completely at the mercy of wind and weather.
Take that triumph of engineering skill, the &#8216;Nulli Secundus,&#8217;
for example. The gas-bag, which was sausage-shaped and
30 feet in diameter, was a beautiful piece of workmanship,
the whole thing being built up of goldbeater&#8217;s skin. The
cost of this wonderful gas-bag must have been enormous.
The whole construction, including the car, the system of
suspension, the engine and propellers, had been well thought
out and the work beautifully executed; still, under these
most favourable conditions, only a slight shower of rain was
sufficient to neutralise its lifting effect completely&mdash;that is,
the gas-bag and the cordage about this so-called airship
absorbed about 400 lbs. of water, and this was found to be
more than sufficient to neutralise completely the lifting
effect. A slight squall which followed entirely wrecked the
whole thing, and it was ignominiously carted back to the
point of departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;We now learn that the War Office is soon to produce
another airship similar to the &#8216;Nulli Secundus,&#8217; but with a
much greater capacity and a stronger engine. In the newspaper
accounts it is said that the gas-bag of this new balloon
would be sausage-shaped and 42 feet in diameter, that it is
to be provided with an engine of 100 horse-power, which it
is claimed will give to this new production a speed of
40 miles an hour through the air, so that, with a wind of
20 miles an hour, it will still be able to travel by land
20 miles an hour against the wind. Probably the writer of
the article did not consider the subject from a mathematical
point of view. As the mathematical equation is an extremely
simple one, it is easily presented so as to be understood by
any one having the least smattering of mathematical or
engineering knowledge. The cylindrical portion of the gas-bag
is to be 42 feet in diameter; the area of the cross-section
would therefore be 1,385 feet. If we take a disc 42 feet in
diameter and erect it high in the air above a level plain,
and allow a wind of 40 miles an hour, which is the proposed
speed of the balloon, to blow against it, we should find that
the air pressure would be 11,083 lbs.&mdash;that is, a wind blowing
at a velocity of 40 miles an hour would produce a pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of 8 lbs. to every square foot of the disc.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Conversely, if the
air were stationary, it would require a push of 11,083 lbs. to
drive this disc through the air at the rate of 40 miles an
hour.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Haswell gives the pressure of the wind at 40 miles an hour as 8 lbs.
per square foot, and this is said to have been verified by the United
States Coast Survey. Molesworth makes it slightly less; but the new
formula, according to most recent experiments (Dr. Stanton&#8217;s experiments
at the National Physical Laboratory and M. Eiffel&#8217;s at Eiffel Tower),
is P = 0&middot;003 V&sup2;, which would make the pressure only 4&middot;8 lbs. per square
foot, and which would reduce the total H.P. required from 472 to 283,
where P represents pounds per square foot and V miles per hour.</p></div>

<p>&#8220;A speed of 40 miles an hour is at the rate of 3,520 feet
in a minute of time. We therefore have two factors&mdash;the
pounds of resistance encountered, and the distance through
which the disc travels in one minute of time. By multiplying
the total pounds of pressure on the complete disc by
the number of feet it has to travel in one minute of time, we
have the total number of foot-pounds required in a minute
of time to drive a disc 42 feet in diameter through the air
at a speed of 40 miles an hour. Dividing the product by
the conventional horse-power 33,000, we shall have 1,181
horse-power as the energy required to propel the disc through
the air. However, the end of the gas-bag is not a flat disc,
but a hemisphere, and the resistance to drive a hemisphere
through the air is much less than it would be with a normal
plane or flat disc. In the &#8216;Nulli Secundus&#8217; we may take
the coefficient of resistance of the machine, considered as a
whole, as 0&middot;20&mdash;that is, that the resistance will be one-fifth
as much as that of a flat disc. This, of course, includes not
only the resistance of the balloon itself, but also that of the
cordage, the car, the engine, and the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Multiplying 1,181 by the coefficient &middot;20, we shall have
236; therefore, if the new balloon were attached to a long
steel wire and drawn by a locomotive through the air, the
amount of work or energy required would be 236 horse-power&mdash;that
is, if the gas-bag would stand being driven
through the air at the rate of 40 miles an hour, which is
extremely doubtful. Under these conditions, the driving
wheels of the locomotive would not slip, and therefore no
waste of power would result, but in the dirigible balloon
we have a totally different state of affairs. The propelling
screws are very small in proportion to the airship, and their
slip is fully 50 per cent.&mdash;that is, in order to drive the ship
at the rate of 40 miles an hour, the screws would have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
travel at least 80 miles an hour. Therefore, while 236 horse-power
was imparted to the ship in driving it forward, an
equal amount would have to be lost in slip, or, in other
words, in driving the air rearwards. It would, therefore,
require 472 horse-power instead of 100 to drive the proposed
new balloon through the air at the rate of 40 miles an hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be seen from this calculation that the new
airship will still be at the mercy of the wind and
weather. Those who pin their faith on the balloon as
the only means of navigating the air may dispute my
figures. However, all the factors in the equation are
extremely simple and well known, and no one can
dispute any of them except the assumed coefficient of
resistance, which is given here as &middot;20. The writer feels
quite sure that, after careful experiments are made, it
will be found that this coefficient is nearer &middot;40 than &middot;20,
especially so at high speeds when the air pressure
deforms the gas-bag. Only a slight bagging in the front
end of the balloon would run the coefficient up to fully &middot;50,
and perhaps even more.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Times</i>, Feb. 26, 1908.</p>

<div class="capdiv">
<p class="caption">Fig. 73.&mdash;The enormous balloon, &#8220;Ville de Paris,&#8221; of the French Government.
This balloon is a beautiful piece of workmanship, and is said to
be the most practical balloon ever invented, not excepting the balloon
of Count Zeppelin. Some idea of its size may be obtained by
comparing it with the size of the men who are standing immediately
underneath.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Since writing the <i>Times</i> article, a considerable degree of
success has been attained by Count Zeppelin. According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to newspaper accounts, his machine has a diameter of
about 40 feet, and a length of no less than 400 feet. It
appears that this balloon consists of a very light aluminium
envelope, which is used in order to produce a smooth
and even surface, give rigidity, and take the place of
the network employed in ordinary balloons. It seems
that the gas is carried in a large number of bags fitted
in the interior of this aluminium envelope. However,
by getting a firm and smooth exterior and by making
his apparatus of very great length as relates to its
diameter, he has obtained a lower coefficient of resistance
than has ever been obtained before, and as his balloon
is of great volume, he is able to carry powerful motors
and use screw propellers of large diameter. It appears
that he has made a circuit of considerable distance,
and returned to the point of departure without any
accident. A great deal of credit is, therefore, due to
him. His two first balloons came to grief very quickly;
he was not discouraged, but stuck to the job with true
Teutonic grit, and has perhaps attained a higher degree
of success than has ever been attained with a balloon.
However, some claim that the French Government balloon,
&#8220;La Patrie&#8221; is superior to the Zeppelin balloon at all
points. When we take into consideration the fact that
the Zeppelin machine is 400 feet long and lighter than
the same volume of air, it becomes only too obvious
that such a bulky and extremely delicate and fragile
affair will easily be destroyed. Of course ascensions will
only be made in very favourable weather, but squalls
and sudden gusts of wind are liable to occur. It is
always possible to start out in fine weather if one waits
long enough, but if a flight of 24 hours or even 12 hours
is to be attempted, the wind may be blowing very briskly
when we return, and an ordinary wind will not only
prevent the housing of Count Zeppelin&#8217;s balloon, but will
be extremely liable to reduce it to a complete wreck in
a few minutes.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Shortly after this was written, the Zeppelin machine was completely
demolished by a gust of wind.</p></div>

<p>I am still strongly of the opinion that the ultimate
mastery of the air must be accomplished by machines
heavier than the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a year or so ago, our authorities were talking of
aerial navigation in its relation to war as &#8216;an interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and instructive study.&#8217; Now we must reckon it as the
gravest problem of the moment. The cleverest aeronauts
in England should be called upon at once to design an
airship, not only as efficient as that of Count Zeppelin&#8217;s,
but possessed of even greater speed. (His average was
said to be about 34 miles an hour.) In speed will lie the
supremacy of the air when it comes to actual warfare. Of
two opposing airships, the faster will be able to outman&#339;uvre
its adversary and hold it at its mercy.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Daily
Mail</i>, July 11, 1908.</p>

<p class="center">A LANDING OF 350,000 MEN.</p>

<p>Herr Rudolph Martin, author of books on war in the air
and &#8220;Is a World-War Imminent?&#8221; points out how England
is losing her insular character by the development of airships
and aeroplanes.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a world-war,&#8221; he said to me, &#8220;Germany would have
to spend two hundred millions sterling in motor airships,
and a similar amount in aeroplanes, to transport 350,000
men in half an hour during the night from Calais to Dover.
Even to-day the landing of a large German army in England
is a mere matter of money. I am opposed to a war between
Germany and England, but should it break out to-day, it
would last at least two years, for we would conclude no
peace until a German army had occupied London.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my judgment it would take two years for us to build
motor airships enough simultaneously to throw 350,000 men
into Dover <i>via</i> Calais. During the same night, of course, a
second transport of 350,000 men could follow. The newest
Zeppelin airship can comfortably carry fifty persons from
Calais to Dover. The ships which the Zeppelin works in
Friedrichshafen will build during the next few months are
likely to be considerably larger than IV., and will carry one
hundred persons. There is no technical reason against the
construction of Zeppelin airships of 1,100,000 or even
1,700,000 cubic feet capacity, or twice or three times the
capacity of IV. (500,000 cubic feet).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I am at present organising a German &#8216;Air Navy League,&#8217;
to establish air-traffic routes in Germany. Aluminium airships
could carry on regular traffic between Berlin and
London, Paris, Cologne, Munich, Vienna, Moscow, Copenhagen,
and Stockholm. In war time these ships would be
at the disposal of the German Empire.</p>

<p>&#8220;The development of motor airship navigation will lead
to a perpetual alliance between England and Germany.
The British fleet will continue to rule the waves, while
Germany&#8217;s airships and land armies will represent the
mightiest Power on the Continent of Europe.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Daily Mail</i>,
July 11, 1908.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the above was written before
the wreck of Zeppelin&#8217;s machine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For many years scientific mechanicians and mathematicians
have told us that the navigation of the air was quite
possible. They have said it is only a question of motive
power; &#8220;Give us a motor that is sufficiently light and strong,
and we will very soon give you a practical flying machine.&#8221;
A domestic goose weighs about 12 lbs., and it has been
estimated that it only exerts about one-twelfth part of a
horse-power in flying&mdash;that is, it is able to exert one man-power
with a weight of only 12 lbs., which seems to be a
very good showing for the goose. However, at the present
moment, we are able to make motors which develop the
power of ten men&mdash;that is, one horse-power&mdash;with less than
the weight of a common barnyard fowl. Under these conditions
it is quite evident that if a machine can be so
designed that it will not be too wasteful in power, it must
be a success. It is admitted by scientific men that all
animals, such as horses, deer, dogs, and also birds, are able
to develop much more dynamic energy for the carbon consumed
than is possible with any thermodynamic machine
that we are able to make. It may be said that many
animals are able to develop the full dynamic energy of the
carbon they consume, whereas the best of our motors do not
develop more than 10 per cent. of the energy contained in
the combustibles that they consume; but, as against this,
it must be remembered that birds feed on grass, fruit, fish,
etc., heavy and bulky materials containing only a small
percentage of carbon, whereas with a motor we are able to
use a pure hydrocarbon that has locked up in its atoms
more than twenty times as much energy per pound as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
ordinary food consumed by birds. I think, in fact I assert,
that the time has now arrived, having regard to the advanced
state of the art in building motors, when it will be quite
a simple and safe affair to erect works and turn out
successful flying machines at less cost than motor cars;
in fact, there is nothing that stands in the way of success
to-day. The value of a successful flying machine, when
considered from a purely military standpoint, cannot be
over-estimated. The flying machine has come, and come to
stay, and whether we like it or not, it is a problem that
must be taken into serious consideration. If we are laggards
we shall, unquestionably, be left behind, with a strong probability
that before many years have passed over our heads,
we shall have to change the colouring of our school maps.</p>

<p>In my early &#8220;whirling table&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> experiments, the
aeroplanes used were from 6 inches to 4 feet in width.
They were for the most part made of thin pine, being
slightly concave on the underneath side and convex on
the top, both the fore and aft edges being very sharp.
I generally mounted them at an angle of 1 in 14<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;that
is, in such a position that in advancing 14 feet they
pressed the air down 1 foot. With this arrangement,
I found that with a screw thrust of 5 lbs. the aeroplane
would lift 5 &times; 14, or 70 lbs., while if the same plane
was mounted at an angle of 1 in 10, the lifting effect
was almost 50 lbs. (5 &times; 10). This demonstrated that
the skin friction on these very sharp, smooth and well-made
aeroplanes was so small a factor as not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
considered. When, however, there was the least irregularity
in the shape of the aeroplane, the lifting effect,
when considered in terms of screw thrust, was greatly
diminished. With a well-made wooden plane placed at
an angle of 1 in 14, I was able to carry as much as
113 lbs. to the H.P., whereas with an aeroplane consisting
of a wooden frame covered with a cotton fabric (<a href="#Fig75">Fig. 75</a>),
I was only able to carry 40 lbs. to the H.P.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>These facts taken into consideration with my other
experiments with large aeroplanes, demonstrated to my
mind that it would not be a very easy matter to make a
large and efficient aeroplane. If I obtained the necessary
rigidity by making it of boards, it would be vastly too
heavy for the purpose, while if I obtained the necessary
lightness by making the framework of steel and covering
it with a silk or cotton fabric in the usual way, the
distortion would be so great that it would require
altogether too much power to propel it through the
air. I therefore decided on making a completely new
form of aeroplane. I constructed a large steel framework
arranged in such a manner that the fore and aft edges
consisted of tightly drawn steel wires. This framework
was provided with a number of light wooden longitudinal
trusses, similar to those shown in <a href="#Fig76">Fig. 76</a>. The bottom
side was then covered with balloon fabric secured at the
edges, and also by two longitudinal lines of lacing
through the centre. It was stretched very tightly and
slightly varnished, but not sufficiently to make it absolutely
air-tight. The top of this framework was covered with
the same kind of material, but varnished so as to make
it absolutely airtight. The top and bottom were then
laced together forming very sharp fore and aft edges,
and the top side was firmly secured to the light wooden
trusses before referred to. Upon running this aeroplane,
I found that a certain quantity of air passed through
the lower side and set up a pressure between the upper
and lower coverings. The imprisoned air pressed the
top covering upward, forming longitudinal corrugations
which did not offer any perceptible resistance to the air,
whereas the bottom fabric, having practically the same
pressure on both sides, was not distorted in the least.
This aeroplane was found to be nearly as efficient as it
would have been had it been carved out of a solid piece
of wood. It will be seen by the illustration that this
large or main aeroplane is practically octagonal in shape,
its greatest width being 50 feet, and the total area

<h3>EXPERIMENTS WITH A LARGE MACHINE.</h3>

<p>Upon running my large machine over the track (<a href="#Fig77">Fig. 77</a>)
with only the main aeroplane in position, I found that
a lifting effect of 3,000 to 4,000 lbs. could be obtained with
a speed of 37 to 42 miles an hour. It was not always
an easy matter to ascertain exactly what the lifting effect
was at a given speed on account of the wind that was
generally blowing. Early in my experiments, I found
if I ran my machine fast enough to produce a lifting effect
within 1,000 lbs. of the total weight of the machine, that it
was almost sure to leave the rails if the least wind was
blowing. It was, therefore, necessary for me to devise some
means of keeping the machine on the track. The first plan
tried was to attach some very heavy cast-iron wheels
weighing with their axle-trees and connections about
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> tons. These were constructed in such a manner that
the light flanged wheels supporting the machine on the
steel rails could be lifted 6 inches above the track, leaving
the heavy wheels still on the rails for guiding the machine.
This arrangement was tried on several occasions, the
machine being run fast enough to lift the forward end
off the track. However, I found considerable difficulty in
starting and stopping quickly on account of the great
weight, and the amount of energy necessary to set such
heavy wheels spinning at a high velocity. The last experiment
with these wheels was made when a head wind was
blowing at the rate of about 10 miles an hour. It was
rather unsteady, and when the machine was running at its
greatest velocity, a sudden gust lifted not only the front
end, but also the heavy front wheels completely off the
track, and the machine falling on soft ground was soon
blown over by the wind.</p>

<p>I then provided a safety track of 3 &times; 9 Georgia pine
placed about 2 feet above the steel rails, the wooden track
being 30 feet gauge and the steel rails 9 feet gauge (<a href="#Fig77">Fig. 77</a>).
The machine was next furnished with four extra wheels
placed on strong outriggers and adjusted in such a manner
that when it had been lifted 1 inch clear of the steel rails,
these extra wheels would engage the upper wooden track.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Springs were interposed between the machine and the axle-trees.
The travel of these springs was about 4 inches; therefore, when the
machine was standing still, the wheels on the outriggers were about
5 inches below the upper track.</p>

the exact lifting effect at all speeds, and to arrange my aeroplanes in
such a manner that the center of lifting effect was directly over the
center of gravity. The paper-covered cylinders made one rotation in
2,000 feet.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>When fully equipped, my large machine had five long
and narrow aeroplanes projecting from each side. Those
that are attached to the sides of the main aeroplanes are
27 feet long, thus bringing the total width of the machine
up to 104 feet. The machine is also provided with a fore
and an aft rudder made on the same general plan as
the main aeroplane. When all the aeroplanes are in
position, the total lifting surface is brought up to about
6,000 square feet. I have, however, never run the machine
with all the planes in position. My late experiments were
conducted with the main aeroplane, the fore and aft
rudders, and the top and bottom side planes in position,
the total area then being 4,000 square feet. With the
machine thus equipped, with 600 lbs. of water in the tank
and boiler and with the naphtha and three men on board,
the total weight was a little less than 8,000 lbs. The first
run under these conditions was made with a steam pressure
of 150 lbs. to the square inch, in a dead calm, and all four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of the lower wheels remained constantly on the rails, none
of the wheels on the outriggers touching the upper track.
The second run was made with 240 lbs. steam pressure
to the square inch. On this occasion, the machine seemed
to vibrate between the upper and lower tracks. About
three of the top wheels were engaged at the same time, the
weight on the lower steel rails being practically nil. Preparations
were then made for a third run with nearly the
full power of the engines. The machine was tied up to a
dynamometer (<a href="#Fig78">Fig. 78</a>), and the engines were started with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
pressure of about 200 lbs. to the square inch. The gas
supply was then gradually turned on with the throttle
valves wide open; the pressure soon increased, and when
310 lbs. was reached, the dynamometer showed a screw
thrust of 2,100 lbs.,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but to this must be added the incline
of the track which amounts to about 64 lbs. The actual
thrust was therefore 2,164 lbs. In order to keep the thrust
of the screws as nearly constant as possible, I had placed a
small safety valve&mdash;<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch&mdash;in the steam pipe leading to
one of the engines. This valve was adjusted in such a
manner that it gave a slight puff of steam at each stroke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the engine with a pressure of 310 lbs. to the square inch,
and a steady blast at 320 lbs. to the square inch. As the
valves and steam passages of these engines were made very
large, and as the piston speed was not excessive, I believed
if the steam pressure was kept constant that the screw
thrust would also remain nearly constant, because as the
machine advances and the screws commence to run slightly
faster, an additional quantity of steam will be called for and
this could be supplied by turning on more gas. When
everything was ready, with careful observers stationed on
each side of the track, the order was given to let go. The
enormous screw thrust started the machine so quickly that
it nearly threw the engineers off their feet, and the machine
bounded over the track at a great rate. Upon noticing
a slight diminution in the steam pressure, I turned on
more gas, when almost instantly the steam commenced
to blow a steady blast from the small safety valve, showing
that the pressure was at least 320 lbs. in the pipes supplying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the engines with steam. Before starting on this run, the
wheels that were to engage the upper track were painted,
and it was the duty of one of my assistants to observe
these wheels during the run, while another assistant
watched the pressure gauges and dynagraphs (<a href="#Fig79">Fig. 79</a>).
The first part of the track was up a slight incline, but the
machine was lifted clear of the lower rails and all of the
top wheels were fully engaged on the upper track when
about 600 feet had been covered. The speed rapidly
increased, and when 900 feet had been covered, one of the
rear axle-trees, which were of 2-inch steel tubing, doubled
up (<a href="#Fig80">Fig. 80</a>), and set the rear end of the machine completely
free. The pencils ran completely across the cylinders
of the dynagraphs and caught on the underneath end.
The rear end of the machine being set free, raised considerably
above the track and swayed. At about 1,000
feet, the left forward wheel also got clear of the upper track
and shortly afterwards, the right forward wheel tore up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
about 100 feet of the upper track. Steam was at once
shut off and the machine sank directly to the earth
imbedding the wheels in the soft turf (<a href="#Fig81">Figs. 81</a> and <a href="#Fig82">82</a>)
without leaving any other marks, showing most conclusively
that the machine was completely suspended in
the air before it settled to the earth. In this accident,
one of the pine timbers forming the upper track went
completely through the lower framework of the machine
and broke a number of the tubes, but no damage was done
to the machinery except a slight injury to one of the
screws (<a href="#Fig83">Fig. 83</a>).</p>

<p>In my experiments with the small apparatus for ascertaining
the power required to perform artificial flight,
I found that the most advantageous angle for my aeroplane
was 1 in 14, but when I came to make my large machine,
I placed my aeroplanes at an angle of 1 in 8 so as to
be able to get a great lifting effect at a moderate speed with
a short run. In the experiments which led to the accident
above referred to, the total lifting effect upon the machine
must have been at least 10,000 lbs. All the wheels which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
had been previously painted and which engaged the upper
track were completely cleaned of their paint and had made
an impression on the wood, which clearly indicated that the
load which they had been lifting was considerable.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Moreover, the strain necessary to double up the axle-trees
was fully 1,000 lbs. each, without considering the lift on
the forward axle-trees which did not give way but broke
the upper track.</p>

<p>The advantages arising from driving the aeroplanes on
to new air, the inertia of which has not been disturbed, are
clearly shown in these experiments. The lifting effect of
the planes was 2&middot;5 lbs. per square foot. A plane loaded at
this rate will fall through the air with a velocity of
22&middot;36 miles per hour, according to the formula &#8730;<span class="bt">200 &times; P</span> = V.
But as the planes were set at an angle of 1 in 8, and as
the machine travelled at the rate of 40 miles an hour, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
planes only pressed the air downwards 5 miles an hour
(40 &divide; 8 = 5). A fall of 5 miles an hour without advancing
would only exert a pressure of &middot;125 lb. per square foot,
according to the formula (V&sup2; &times; &middot;005 = P).<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> This is the old formula used by Haswell. The account of this
experimental work was written in the autumn of 1894 and Haswell&#8217;s
formula was used. I have thought best to make no changes.</p></div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Engineers and mathematicians who have written to
prove that flying machines were impossible have generally
computed the efficiency of aeroplanes moving through the
air, on the basis that the lifting effect would be equal to a
wind blowing against the plane at the rate at which the
air was pressed down by the plane while being driven
through the air. According to this system of reasoning,
my 4,000 square feet of aeroplanes would have lifted only
&middot;125 lb. per square foot, and in order to have lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
10,000 lbs. they would have to have had an area twenty
times as great. This corresponds exactly with the discrepancy
which Professor Langley has found in the formula
of Newton.</p>

<p>With aeroplanes of one-half the width of those I
employed, and with a velocity twice as great, the angle
could be much less, and the advantages of continually
running on to fresh air would be still more manifest. With
a screw thrust of 2,000 lbs., the air pressure on each square
foot of the projected area of the screw blades is 21&middot;3 lbs.,
while the pressure on the entire discs of the screws is 4 lbs.
per square foot, which would seem to show with screws of
this size, that four blades would be more efficient than two.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig85">

<div class="capdiv">
<p class="capcenter">Fig. 85.&mdash;One pair of my compound engines. This engine weighed 310 lbs.
and developed 180 H.P., with 320 lbs. of steam per square inch.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The engines, as before stated, are compound (<a href="#Fig85">Fig. 85</a>).
The area of the high-pressure piston is 20 square inches, and
that of the low-pressure piston is 50&middot;26 square inches. Both
have a stroke of 12 inches. With a boiler pressure of 320 lbs.,
the pressure on the low-pressure piston is 125 lbs. to the
square inch. This abnormally high pressure in the low-pressure
cylinder is due to the fact that there is a very large
amount of clearance in the high-pressure cylinder to prevent
shock in case water should go over when the machine
pitches; moreover, the steam in the high-pressure cylinder
is cut off at three-quarters stroke, while the steam in the
low-pressure cylinder is cut off at five-eighths stroke. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
we should compute the power of these engines with the
steam entering at full stroke, without any friction, and with
no back pressure on the low-pressure cylinder, the total
horse-power would foot up to 461&middot;36 horse-power at the
speed at which the engines were run&mdash;namely, 375 turns
per minute. If we compute the actual power consumed by
the screws, by multiplying their thrust, which is probably
2,000 lbs. while they are travelling, by their pitch, 16 feet,
and this by the number of turns which they make in a
minute, and then divide the product by 33,000,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="divisionlg"><span class="num">2,000 &times; 16 &times; 375</span><span class="denom">33,000</span></span>
= 363&middot;63,</p>

<p>we find that we have 363&middot;63 horse-power in actual effect
delivered on the screws of the machine, which shows that
there is rather less than 22 per cent. loss in the engines, due
to cutting off before the end of the stroke, to back pressure,
and to friction. The actual power applied to the machine
being 363&middot;63 horse-power, it is interesting to know what
becomes of it. When the machine has advanced 40 miles
(which it would do in an hour), the screws have travelled
68&middot;1 miles <span class="fsize125">(</span><span class="division"><span class="num">375 &times; 16 &times; 60</span><span
class="denom">5,280</span></span><span class="fsize125">)</span> = 68&middot;1; therefore, 150 horse-power
is wasted in slip, and 213&middot;63 horse-power consumed
in driving the machine through the air. Now, as the planes
are set at an angle of 1 in 8, the power actually used in
lifting the machine is 133&middot;33, and the loss in driving the
body of the machine, its framework and wires through the
air is 90&middot;30 horse-power.</p>

<h3>THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF
VERY NARROW PLANES.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig86">
<img src="images/fig86.png" alt="" width="450" height="451" />
<div class="capdiv">
<p class="capcenter">Fig. 86.&mdash;The path that the air has to take in passing between superposed
aeroplanes in close proximity to each other. By this arrangement the
drift is considerably increased.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>My experiments have demonstrated that relatively narrow
aeroplanes lift more per square foot than very wide ones;
but as an aeroplane, no matter how narrow it may be, must
of necessity have some thickness, it is not advantageous to
place them too near together. Suppose that aeroplanes
should be made <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch thick, and be superposed 3 inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
apart&mdash;that is, at a pitch of 3 inches&mdash;one-twelfth part of the
whole space through which these planes would have to be
driven would be occupied by the planes themselves, and
eleven-twelfths would be air space (<a href="#Fig86">Fig. 86</a>). If a group
of planes thus mounted should be driven through the air
at the rate of 36 miles an hour,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the air would have to be
driven forward at the rate of 3 miles an hour, or else it
would have to be compressed, or spun out, and pass between
the spaces at a speed of 39 miles an hour. As a matter of
fact, however, the difference in pressure is so very small
that practically no atmospheric compression takes place.
The air, therefore, is driven forward at the rate of 3 miles
an hour, and this consumes a great deal of power; in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
so much that there is a decided disadvantage in using
narrow planes thus arranged.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The arrows in the accompanying drawings show the direction of the
air currents, the experiments having been made with stationary planes in
a moving current of air.</p></div>

<p>In regard to the curvature of narrow aeroplanes, I have
found that if one only desires to lift a large load in proportion
to the area, the planes may be made very hollow
on the underneath side; but when one considers the lift in
terms of the screw thrust, I find it advisable that the planes
should be as thin as possible, and the underneath side nearly
flat. I have also found that it is a great advantage to
arrange the planes after the manner shown in <a href="#Fig87">Fig. 87</a>. In
this manner the sum of all the spaces between the planes
is equal to the whole area occupied by the planes; consequently,
the air neither has to be compressed, spun out,
nor driven forward. I am, therefore, able by this arrangement
to produce a large lifting effect per square foot, and, at the
same time, to keep the screw thrust within reasonable limits.</p>

<p>A large number of experiments with very narrow aeroplanes
have been conducted by Mr. Horatio Philipps at
Harrow, in England. <a href="#Fig88">Fig. 88</a> shows a cross-section of one
of Mr. Philipps&#8217; planes. Mr. Philipps is of the opinion that
the air, in striking the top side of the plane, is thrown
upwards in the manner shown, and a partial vacuum is
thereby formed over the central part of the plane, and that
the lifting effect of planes made in this form is therefore
very much greater than with ordinary narrow planes. I
have experimented with these &#8220;sustainers&#8221; (as Mr. Philipps
calls them) myself, and I find it is quite true that they lift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in some cases as much as 8 lbs. per square foot,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but the
lifting effect is not produced in the exact manner that Mr.
Philipps seems to suppose. The air does not glance off in
the manner shown. As the &#8220;sustainer&#8221; strikes the air two
currents are formed, one following the exact contour of the
top, and the other that of the bottom. These two currents
join and are thrown downwards, as relates to the &#8220;sustainer,&#8221;
at an angle which is the resultant of the angles at which
the two currents meet. These &#8220;sustainers&#8221; may be made
to lift when the front edge is lower than the rear edge,
because they encounter still air, and leave it with a downward
motion.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> In my early experiments I lifted as much as 8 lbs. per square foot with
aeroplanes which were only slightly curved, but very thin and sharp.</p></div>

illustration.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In my experiments with narrow superposed planes, I
have always found that with strips of thin metal made
sharp at both edges and only slightly curved, the lifting
effect, when considered in terms of screw thrust, was always
greater than with any arrangement of the wooden aeroplanes
used in Philipps&#8217; experiments. It would, therefore,
appear that there is no advantage in the peculiar form of
&#8220;sustainer&#8221; employed by this inventor.</p>

effect no matter in which direction it is run, because, as it
advances, it encounters stationary air which is divided into
two streams. The top stream being unable to fly off at a
tangent when turning over the top curve, flows down the
incline and joins the current which is flowing over the lower
horizontal surface. The angle at which the combined
stream of air leaves the plane is the resultant of these two
angles; consequently, as the plane finds the air in a
stationary condition, and leaves it with a downward
motion, the plane itself must be lifted. It is true that small
and narrow aeroplanes may be made to lift considerably
more per square foot of surface than very large ones, but
they do not offer the same safeguard against a rapid descent
to the earth in case of a stoppage or breakdown of the
machinery. With a large aeroplane properly adjusted, a
rapid and destructive fall to the earth is quite impossible.</p>

<h3>THE EFFICIENCY OF SCREW PROPELLERS,
STEERING, STABILITY, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>Before I commenced my experiments at Baldwyn&#8217;s Park,
I attempted to obtain some information in regard to the
action of screw propellers working in the air. I went to
Paris and saw the apparatus which the French Government
employed for testing the efficiency of screw propellers, but
the propellers were so very badly made that the experiments
were of no value. Upon consulting an English
experimenter, who had made a &#8220;life-long study&#8221; of the
question, he assured me that I should find the screw propeller
very inefficient and very wasteful of power, and
that all screw propellers had a powerful fan-blower action,
drawing in air at the centre and discharging it with great
force at the periphery. I found that no two men were
agreed as to the action of screw propellers. All the data or
formul&aelig; available were so confusing and contradictory as to
be of no value whatsoever. Some experimenters were of
the opinion that, in computing the thrust of a screw, we
should only consider the projected area of the blades, and
that the thrust would be equal to a wind blowing against a
normal plane of equal area at a velocity equal to the slip.
Others were of the opinion that the whole screw disc would
have to be considered; that is, that the thrust would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
equal to a wind blowing against a normal plane having an
area equal to the whole disc, and at the velocity of the slip.
The projected area of the two screw blades of my machine
is 94 square feet, and the area of the two screw discs is 500
square feet. According to the first system of reasoning,
therefore, the screw thrust of my large machine, when
running at 40 miles an hour with a slip of 18 miles per hour,
would have been, according to the well-known formula,</p>

<p class="center">V&sup2; &times; &middot;005 = P</p>

<p class="center">18&sup2; &times; &middot;005 &times; 94 = 152&middot;28 lbs.</p>

<p>If, however, we should have considered the whole screw
disc, it would have been 18&sup2; &times; &middot;005 &times; 500 = 810 lbs.
However, when the machine was run over the track at this
rate, the thrust was found to be rather more than 2,000 lbs.
When the machine was secured to the track and the screws
revolved until the pitch in feet, multiplied by the turns per
minute, was equal to 68 miles an hour, it was found that
the screw thrust was 2,164 lbs. In this case, it was of course,
all slip, and when the screws had been making a few
turns they had established a well-defined air-current, and
the power exerted by the engine was simply to maintain
this air current. It is interesting to note that, if we
compute the projected area of these blades by the foregoing
formula, the thrust would be&mdash;68&sup2; &times; &middot;005 &times; 94 = 2,173&middot;28 lbs.,
which is almost exactly the observed screw thrust.</p>

<p>When I first commenced my experiments with a large
machine, I did not know exactly what sort of boiler, gas
generator, or burner I should finally adopt; I did not know
the exact size that it would be necessary to make my
engines; I did not know the size, the pitch, or the diameter
of the screws which would be the most advantageous;
neither did I know the form of aeroplane which I should
finally adopt. It was, therefore, necessary for me to make
the foundation or platform of my machine of such a
character that it would allow me to make the modifications
necessary to arrive at the best results. The platform of the
machine is, therefore, rather larger than is necessary, and I
find if I were to design a completely new machine, that it
would be possible to greatly reduce the weight of the framework,
and, what is still more, to greatly reduce the force
necessary to drive it through the air.</p>

<p class="capcenter">Fig. 89.&mdash;One of the large screws being hoisted into position. Its size
may be judged by comparison with the man.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the present time, the body of my machine is a large
platform, about 8 feet wide and 40 feet long. Each side is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
formed of very long trusses of steel tubes, braced in every
direction by strong steel wires. The trusses which give
stiffness are all below the platform. In designing a new
machine, I should make the trusses much deeper and at the
same time very much lighter, and, instead of having them
below the platform on which the boiler is situated, I should
have them constructed in such a manner as to completely
enclose the boiler and the greater part of the machinery.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
I should make the cross-section of the framework rectangular
and pointed at each end. I should cover the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
outside very carefully with balloon material, giving it a
perfectly smooth and even surface throughout, so that it
might be easily driven through the air.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> This arrangement of the framework is now common to all successful
machines.</p></div>

<p>In regard to the screws, I am at the present time able to
mount screws 17 feet 10 inches in diameter (<a href="#Fig89">Fig. 89</a>). I
find, however, that my machine would be much more
efficient if the screws were 24 feet in diameter and I
believe with such very large screws, four blades would be
much more efficient than two.</p>

<p>My machine may be steered to the right or to the left by
running one of the propellers faster than the other. Very
convenient throttle valves have been provided to facilitate
this system of steering. An ordinary vertical rudder placed
just after the screws may, however, prove more convenient
if not more efficient.</p>

<p>The machine is provided with fore and aft horizontal
rudders, both of which are connected with the same
windlass.</p>

<p>In regard to the stability of the machine, the centre
of weight is much below the centre of lifting effect;
moreover, the upper wings are set at such an angle that
whenever the machine tilts to the right or to the left
the lifting effect is increased on the lower side and
diminished on the higher side. This simple arrangement
makes it automatic as far as rolling is concerned. I am
of the opinion that whenever flying machines come into
use, it will be necessary to steer in a vertical direction
by means of an automatic steering gear controlled by
a gyroscope. It will certainly not be more difficult to
man&#339;uvre and steer such machines than it is to control
completely submerged torpedoes.</p>

<p>When the machine is once perfected, it will not require
a railway track to enable it to get the necessary velocity
to rise. A short run over a moderately level field will
suffice. As far as landing is concerned, the aerial
navigator will touch the ground when moving forward,
and the machine will be brought to a state of rest by
sliding on the ground for a short distance. In this
manner very little shock will result, whereas if the
machine is stopped in the air and allowed to fall directly
to the earth without advancing, the shock, although
not strong enough to be dangerous to life or limb, might
be sufficient to disarrange or injure the machinery.</p>

<h3>THE COMPARATIVE VALUE OF
DIFFERENT MOTORS.</h3>

<p>So far I have only discussed the navigation of the
air by the use of propellers driven by a steam engine.
The engines that I employ are what is known as compound
engines&mdash;that is, they have a large and a small cylinder.
Steam at a very high pressure enters the high-pressure
cylinder, expands and escapes at a lower pressure into
a larger cylinder where it again expands and does more
work. A compound engine is more economical in steam
than a simple engine, and therefore requires a smaller
boiler to develop the same horse-power, so that when
we consider the weight of water and fuel for a given
time, together with the weight of the boiler and the
engine, the engine motor with a compound engine is
lighter than a simple engine. However, if only the weight
of the engine is to be considered then the simple engine
will develop more power per unit of weight than the
compound engine. For instance, if, instead of allowing
the steam to enter the small cylinder, and the exhaust
from this cylinder to enter the large or low-pressure
cylinder&mdash;which necessitates that the high-pressure piston
has to work against a back pressure equal to the full
pressure on the low-pressure cylinder&mdash;I should connect
both cylinders direct with the live steam, and allow both
to discharge their exhaust directly into the air, I should
then have a pair of simple engines, and instead of
developing 363 H.P. they would develop fully 500 H.P.,
or nearly 1 H.P. for every pound of their weight. I
mention this fact to show that the engines are exceedingly
light, and that when compared with simple engines their
power should be computed on the same basis. It will,
therefore, be seen that if we do not take into consideration
the steam supply or the amount of fuel and water
necessary, the simple steam engine is an exceedingly
light motor.</p>

<p>But, as before stated, great improvements have recently
been made in oil engines. I have thought much on this
subject, and am of the opinion that if one had an unlimited
supply of money, a series of experiments could be very
profitably conducted with a view of adapting the oil
engine for use on flying machines. If we use a steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
engine, it is necessary to have a boiler, and at best a boiler
is rather a large and heavy object to drive through the
air. If we use an oil engine, no boiler is necessary, and
the amount of heat carried over in the cooling water
will only be one-seventh part of what is carried over
in the exhaust from a steam engine of the same power.
Therefore, the condenser only need be one-seventh part
the size, and consequently should be made lighter with
the tubes placed at a greater distance apart, and thus
reduce the amount of power necessary to drive the machine
through the air. Moreover, the supply of water necessary
will be greatly reduced, and a cheaper and heavier oil
may be employed, which is not so liable to take fire in
case of an accident. It is then only a question as to
whether an oil engine can be made so light as to keep
its weight within that of a steam motor; that is, an
oil engine in order to be available for the purpose must
be as light, including its water supply, as a complete
steam motor, which includes not only the engine, but
also the boiler, the feed pumps, the water supply, the
burner, the gas generator, and six-sevenths of the
condenser. It requires a very perfect steam engine and
boiler, not using a vacuum, to develop a horse-power
with a consumption of 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lbs. of petroleum per hour; but
there are many oil engines which develop a horse-power
with rather less than 1 lb. of oil per hour. It will,
therefore, be seen that, as far as fuel is concerned, the
oil engine has a decided advantage over the more complicated
steam motor. Moreover, with an oil engine, the
cooling water is not under pressure, so that the waste of
water would be much less than with a steam engine, where
the pressure is so high as to cause a considerable amount
of waste through joints and numerous stuffing-boxes.</p>

<p>The great advances that have been made of late years
in electrical science and engineering have led many to
believe that almost any knotty scientific question may
be solved by the employment of electrical engineering,
and a great deal has been written and said in regard
to navigating the air by flying machines driven by
electric motors.</p>

<p>Before I commenced my experiments, I made enquiries
of all the prominent electrical engineering establishments
where there was any likelihood of obtaining light and
efficient electric motors, and found that it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to obtain one that would develop a horse-power for any
considerable time that would weigh less than 150 lbs.
Since that time, notwithstanding that a great deal has
appeared in the public prints about the efficiency and
lightness of electric motors, I am unable to learn of any
concern that is ready to furnish a complete motor, including
a primary battery, which would supply the necessary current
for two hours at a time, at a weight of less than 150 lbs.
per horse-power, and as far as I have been able to ascertain
from what I have myself seen, I cannot learn that there are
any motors in practical use which do not weigh, including
their storage batteries, at least 300 lbs. per horse-power.
The last electric motor which I examined was in a boat; it
was driven by a primary battery which weighed over
1,000 lbs. to the horse-power. From this I am of the
opinion that we cannot at present look to electricity with
any hope of finding a motor which is suitable for the purpose
of aerial navigation.</p>

<h3>ENGINES.</h3>

<p>There is no question but what birds, and for that matter
all animals, when considered as thermo-dynamic machines,
are very perfect motors; they develop the full theoretical
amount of energy of the carbon consumed. This we are
quite unable to do with any artificial machine, but birds,
for the most part, have to content themselves with food
which is not very rich in carbon. It is quite true that
a bird may develop from ten to fifteen times as much power
from the carbon consumed as can be developed by the best
steam engine, but, as an off-set against this, a steam engine
is able to consume petroleum, which has at least twenty
times as many thermal units per pound as the ordinary
food of birds. The movement of a bird&#8217;s wings, from long
years of development, has without doubt attained a great
degree of perfection. Birds are able to scull themselves
through the air with very little loss of energy. To imitate
by mechanical means, the exact and delicate motion of their
wings would certainly be a very difficult task, and I do not
believe that we should attempt it in constructing an artificial
flying machine. In Nature it is necessary that an
animal should be made all in one piece. It is, therefore,
quite out of the question that any part or parts should
revolve. For land animals there is no question but what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
legs are the most perfect system possible, but in terrestrial
locomotion by machinery, not necessarily in one piece,
wheels are found to be much more effective and efficient.
The swiftest animal can only travel for a minute of time at
half the speed of a locomotive, while the locomotive is able
to maintain its much greater speed for many hours at a
time. The largest land animals only weigh about 5 tons,
while the largest locomotives weigh from 60 to 80 tons. In
the sea, the largest animal weighs about 75 tons, while the
ordinary Atlantic liner weighs from 4,000 to 14,000 tons.
The whale, no doubt, is able to maintain a high speed for
several hours at a time, but the modern steamer is able
to maintain a still higher speed for many consecutive days.</p>

<p>As artificial machines for terrestrial and aquatic locomotion
have been made immensely stronger and larger than
land or water animals, so with flying machines, it will be
necessary to construct them much heavier and stronger
than the largest bird. If one should attempt to propel such
a machine with wings, it would be quite as difficult a
problem to solve as it would be to make a locomotive
that would walk on legs. What is required in a flying
machine is something to which a very large amount of
power can be directly and continuously applied without
any intervening levers or joints, and this we find in the
screw propeller.</p>

<p>When the Brayton gas engine first made its appearance,
I commenced drawings of a flying machine, using a modification
of the Brayton motor which I designed expressly
for the purpose; but even this was found to be too heavy,
and it was not until after I had abandoned the vertical
screw system that it was possible for me to design a machine
which, in theory, ought to fly. The next machine which I
considered was on the kite or aeroplane system. This was
also to be driven by an oil engine. Oil engines at that time
were not so simple as now, and, moreover, the system of
ignition was very heavy, cumbersome, and uncertain. Since
that time, however, gas and oil engines have been very
much improved, and the ignition tube which is almost
universally used has greatly simplified the ignition, so
that at the present time, I am of the opinion that an oil
engine might be designed which would be suitable for the
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1889 I had my attention drawn to some very thin,
strong, and comparatively cheap tubes which were being
made in France, and it was only after I had seen these
tubes that I seriously considered the question of making a
flying machine. I obtained a large quantity of them and
found that they were very light, that they would stand
enormously high pressures, and generate a very large
quantity of steam. Upon going into a mathematical calculation
of the whole subject, I found that it would be possible
to make a machine on the aeroplane system, driven by a
steam engine, which would be sufficiently strong to lift
itself into the air. I first made drawings of a steam engine,
and a pair of these engines was afterwards made. These
engines are constructed, for the most part, of a very high
grade of cast steel, the cylinders being only <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> of an inch
thick, the crank shafts hollow, and every part as strong and
light as possible. They are compound, each having a
high-pressure piston with an area of 20 square inches,
a low-pressure piston of 50&middot;26 square inches, and a
common stroke of 1 foot. When first finished, they were
found to weigh 300 lbs. each; but after putting on the oil
cups, felting, painting, and making some slight alterations,
the weight was brought up to 320 lbs. each, or a total of
640 lbs. for the two engines, which have since developed
362 horse-power with a steam pressure of 320 lbs. per square
inch. A photograph of one of these engines is shown
in <a href="#Fig85">Fig. 85</a>.</p>

<p class="center"><b><span class="padl5">.</span><span class="padl5">.</span><span class="padl5">.</span><span class="padl5">.</span><span class="padl5">.</span><span class="padl5">.</span><span class="padl5">.</span><span class="padl5">.</span><span class="padl5">.</span><span class="padl5">.</span></b></p>

<p>When first designing this engine, I did not know how
much power I might require from it. I thought that in
some cases it might be necessary to allow the high-pressure
steam to enter the low-pressure cylinder direct, but as this
would involve a considerable loss, I constructed a species of
an injector. This injector may be so adjusted that when
the steam in the boiler rises above a certain predetermined
point, say 300 lbs. to the square inch, it opens a valve and
escapes past the high-pressure cylinder instead of blowing
off at the safety valve. In escaping through this valve, a
fall of about 200 lbs. pressure per square inch is made to do
work on the surrounding steam and to drive it forward in
the pipe, producing a pressure on the low-pressure piston
considerably higher than the back pressure on the high-pressure
piston. In this way a portion of the work which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
would otherwise be lost is utilised, and it is possible, with
an unlimited supply of steam, to cause the engines to
develop an enormous amount of power.</p>

<p><b>Boiler Experiments.</b>&mdash;The first boiler which I made was
constructed something on the Herreshoff principle, but
instead of having one simple pipe in one very long coil, I
used a series of very small and light pipes, connected in such
a manner that there was a rapid circulation through the
whole&mdash;the tubes increasing in size and number as the
steam was generated. I intended that there should be a
pressure of about 100 lbs. more on the feed water end of the
series than on the steam end, and I believed that this
difference in pressure would be sufficient to ensure a direct
and positive circulation through every tube in the series.
This first boiler was exceedingly light, but the workmanship,
as far as putting the tubes together was concerned,
was very bad, and it was found impossible to so adjust the
supply of water as to make dry steam without overheating
and destroying the tubes.</p>

<div class="capdiv">
<p class="caption">Fig. 90.&mdash;Steam boiler employed in my experiments. With this boiler,

</div>

<p>Before making another boiler I obtained a quantity of
copper tubes, about 8 feet long, <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch external diameter,
and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>50</sub> of an inch thick. I subjected about 100 of these
tubes to an internal pressure of 1 ton per square inch
of cold kerosine oil, and as none of them leaked I did
not test any more, but commenced my experiments by
placing some of them in a white-hot petroleum fire. I
found that I could evaporate as much as 26<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lbs. of water
per square foot of heating surface per hour, and that with a
forced circulation, although the quantity of water passing was
very small but positive, there was no danger of over-heating.
I conducted many experiments with a pressure of over
400 lbs. per square inch, but none of the tubes failed. I
then mounted a single tube in a white-hot furnace, also
with a water circulation, and found that it only burst
under steam at a pressure of 1,650 lbs. per square inch.
A large boiler, having about 800 square feet of heating
surface including the feed-water heater, was then constructed.
It is shown in <a href="#Fig90">Fig. 90</a>. This boiler is about
4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet wide at the bottom, 8 feet long and 6 feet high.
It weighs with the casing, the dome, the smoke stack
and connections, a little less than 1,000 lbs. The water
first passes through a system of small tubes&mdash;<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
diameter and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>60</sub> inch thick&mdash;which were placed at the
top of the boiler and immediately over the larger tubes&mdash;not
shown in the cut. This feed-water heater is found to
be very effective. It utilises the heat of the products of
combustion after they have passed through the boiler
proper and greatly reduces their temperature, while the
feed-water enters the boiler at a temperature of 250&deg; F.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
A forced circulation is maintained in the boiler, the
feed-water entering through a spring valve, the spring
valve being adjusted in such a manner that the pressure
on the water is always 30 lbs. per square inch in excess
of the boiler pressure. This fall of 30 lbs. in pressure
acts upon the surrounding hot water which has already
passed through the tubes, and drives it down through a
vertical outside tube, thus ensuring a positive and rapid
circulation through all the tubes. This apparatus is found
to work extremely well. A little glass tube at the top
provided with a moving button, indicates exactly how
many pounds of water per hour are passing into the boiler.
By this means, the engineer is not only enabled to ascertain
at a glance whether or not the pumps are working,
but also to what degree they are working.</p>

<p>Water may be considered as 2,400 times as efficient as
air, volume for volume, in condensing steam. When a
condenser is made for the purpose of using water as a
cooling agent, a large number of small tubes may be
grouped together in a box, and the water may be pumped
in at one end of the box and discharged at the other end
through relatively small openings; but when air is
employed, the tubes or condensing surface must be widely
distributed, so that a very large amount of air is encountered,
and the air which has struck one tube and become
heated must never strike a second tube.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this, I make my condenser something
in the form of a Venetian blind, the tubes being
made of very thin copper and each tube in the form of
a small aeroplane. These were driven edgewise through
the air, so that the actual volume of air passing between
them is several thousand times greater than the volume of
water passing through a marine condenser. I find that
with such a condenser I can recover the full weight of the
copper tubes in water every five minutes, and if I use
aluminium, in half that time. Moreover, experiments have
shown that a condenser may be made to sustain considerably
more than its own weight and the weight of its
contents in the air, and that all the steam may be condensed
into water sufficiently cool to be pumped with certainty.</p>

<p>I find that the most advantageous position for the
condenser is immediately after the screw propellers. In
this case, if the machine is moving through the air at the
rate of 50 miles an hour, and the slip of the screws is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
15 miles an hour, it follows that the air will be passing
through the condenser at the rate of 65 miles an hour. At
this velocity, the lifting effect on the narrow aeroplanes
forming the condenser is very great, and at the same time
the steam is very rapidly condensed. The tubes are
placed at such an angle as to keep them completely drained

<h3>EXPERIMENTS WITH SMALL MACHINES
ATTACHED TO A ROTATING ARM.</h3>

<p>These experiments demonstrated most conclusively that
as much as 133 lbs. could be sustained and carried by the
expenditure of one horse-power, and that a screw was a
fairly efficient air propeller. They also demonstrated that
a well made aeroplane, placed at an angle of 1 in 14, would
lift practically fourteen times the thrust required to drive
it through the air, and that the skin friction on a smooth
and well finished aeroplane or screw was so small as not
to be considered. A large number of aeroplanes were
experimented with, and it was found that those which
were slightly concave on the underneath side and convex
on the top, both edges being very sharp and the surface
very smooth and regular, were the most efficient; also that
with small screw propellers, two blades having slightly
increasing pitch were the most efficient.</p>

<p>Since writing the foregoing, great progress has been
made with flying machines, and great disasters have
happened to airships or balloons. Count Zeppelin&#8217;s
gigantic airship encountered a squall or thunder shower,
and the work of years, which had cost over &pound;100,000,
was reduced to scrap metal in a few minutes. Similar
disasters have happened to other balloons.</p>

<p>The British Dirigible No. 2 has not attempted a long
flight, but the Wright Brothers, Farman, and De la Grange
have all met with a certain degree of success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>A few months ago, the remarkable feats of the Wright
Brothers in the States were discredited in Europe. It was
claimed that &#8220;the accounts were not authentic,&#8221; &#8220;too good
to be true,&#8221; etc., but recent events have shown that the
Wright Brothers are able to outdo anything that was
reported in the American Press. On many occasions they
have remained in the air for more than an hour, and have
travelled at the rate of 30 to 40 miles an hour; in fact, the
remarkable success of the Wright Brothers has placed the
true flying machine in a new category.</p>

<p>It can no longer be ranked with the philosopher&#8217;s stone
or with perpetual motion. Success is assured, and great
and startling events may take place within the next few
years.</p>
